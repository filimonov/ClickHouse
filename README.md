## What should I do if I find a bug in an Altinity Stable Build?

ClickHouse’s thousands of core features are all well-tested and stable. To maintain that stability, Altinity Stable Builds are built with a CI system that runs tens of thousands of tests against every commit. But of course, things can always go wrong. If that happens, let us know! **We stand behind our work.**

### If you're an Altinity customer:

1. [Contact Altinity support](https://docs.altinity.com/support/) to file an issue.

### If you're not an Altinity customer:

1. Try to upgrade to the latest bugfix release. If you’re using v23.8.8 but you know that v23.8.11.29 exists, start by upgrading to the bugfix. Upgrades to the latest maintenance releases are smooth and safe.
2. Look for similar issues in the [Altinity/ClickHouse](https://github.com/Altinity/ClickHouse/issues) or [ClickHouse/ClickHouse](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues) repos; it's possible the problem has been logged and a fix is on the way.
3. If you can reproduce the bug, try to isolate it. For example, remove pieces of a failing query one by one, creating the simplest scenario where the error still occurs. Creating [a minimal reproducible example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example) is a huge step towards a solution.
4. [File an issue](https://github.com/Altinity/ClickHouse/issues/new/choose) in the Altinity/ClickHouse repo.
