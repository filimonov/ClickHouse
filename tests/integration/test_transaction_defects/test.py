"""Reproductions of open MergeTree transaction defects.

Each test states the behaviour the server does not have, so each fails today and carries
`xfail(strict=True, raises=AssertionError)`. Fixing a defect turns its test into a failure of the
suite, which is the signal to drop the decorator and keep the test as a regression test.

`raises` is what makes the suite mean anything, and it only works if nothing but the defect raises
an `AssertionError`. Without `raises`, `_pytest.skipping` absorbs any exception in any phase into
`xfail`, and a module that executed no test body at all still reports twelve clean expected
failures. With it, an `AssertionError` is the expected failure -- so everything that is not the
defect raises `Precondition` instead: setup, the state a failpoint was supposed to create,
positive controls, and cleanup.

Every request carries an explicit timeout. `Instance.query` defaults to `DEFAULT_QUERY_TIMEOUT`
(600 s) and `requests` with `timeout=None` waits forever, either of which outlasts every budget
here, and a polling loop whose own requests are unbounded has no bound. A request left running in
a worker thread keeps pytest alive at exit whatever `shutdown(wait=False)` says, because
`concurrent.futures` joins its non-daemon workers through an atexit hook. A hung module is worse
than a failed reproduction: it reports nothing.

The node is private to this module because these reproductions cannot share a server: the
failpoints are global, and the removal of a part whose creation has not committed raises a
`LOGICAL_ERROR` that aborts a debug or sanitizer build.
