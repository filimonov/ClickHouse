-- Plain Merge over Distributed over MergeTree without an explicit __aliasMarker call.
-- Nested ALIAS columns (b contains a's subexpression). Reading the alias columns through the
-- Merge table must reconcile the child (Distributed) header by name; a positional reconciliation
-- in StorageMerge::convertAndFilterSourceStream would swap the columns (or fill them with 0).
-- The correct result equals the single-node ('local') result.
--
-- Determinism notes: `x` is kept in GROUP BY so the ALIAS expansion can resolve it (the alias
-- expressions are defined in terms of x); GROUP BY also deduplicates the rows the two shards
-- produce, and ORDER BY x (distinct values) gives a total order independent of the distributed
-- merge order. So every block - local and the distributed variants - yields the same rows.
