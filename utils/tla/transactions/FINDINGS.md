# Findings of the TLA+ model of MergeTree transactions {#findings}

What the model found, and what happened to each finding. Three kinds are recorded here and nowhere else:
counterexamples TLC produced on the baseline scenarios, defects in the model itself that were noticed while
building it, and rows of the design document that the model contradicts.

A finding is classified `code`, `property` or `model`.

- `code` — the counterexample is a behaviour the C++ really has. The entry carries the counterexample, a fix
  applicable to upstream `master`, naming file and function and what changes, and the model variant that encodes
  the fix so the property can be rechecked against it.
- `property` — the C++ produces exactly what the trace shows, and the property misstated what it meant to
  forbid. The entry says what was wrong and what the property now says. A property is never weakened to make a
  red go away; if the design document's row was the thing that was wrong, section 3 records that too.
- `model` — the model let something happen that the code refuses. The entry names the C++ guard the model was
  missing.

Baseline C++ throughout is upstream `master` `2c24b6b9291e`, checked out in this worktree.

## 1. Counterexamples on the baseline {#counterexamples}

| Id | Scenario, bounds | Property | Action sequence (short) | Classification | Resolution | Proposed code fix |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| F2 | `SetSnapshot` at `TID_MAX = 3`, `CSN_MAX = 36`, `SNAPSHOT_TARGETS = {33}` | `NoPrematureDelete` (predicted; the property and the cleanup thread it needs arrive in the next task) | a transaction begins at a snapshot, `SET TRANSACTION SNAPSHOT` lowers its read snapshot, its entry in `snapshots_in_use` stays where `beginTransaction` put it, and `grabOldParts` removes a part the transaction can still read | `code` | the model variant `SET_SNAPSHOT_PROTECTS` encodes the proposed fix and `MC_SetSnapshotFixed` runs it | `TransactionLog` gains a method that moves the entry under `running_list_mutex` and refuses a target below `tail_ptr`; see below |
| F1 | `Base` at `TID_MAX = 3`, `CSN_MAX = 38`, the first run at the transaction count the scenario matrix asks for | `Atomicity` | `t1` inserts `P1` and commits at CSN 34; `t2` takes snapshot 34, drops `P1`, inserts `P2`, and `CommitCreateCSN` writes CSN 35 into the log, which the updater loads while `t2` is still storing; `t3` takes snapshot 35, locks and stores its own removal of `P2`; `t3`'s `SELECT` then reads `{}` | `property` | `AtomicityStep` now excludes the reader's own removals, `h.removing[t]`, from `C`. The design document's row states only the writer's half of the same precedence, recorded in section 3 as S1 | none, the code is right |

### F2 in full {#f2}

**State of the evidence.** This entry is a prediction with a fix, not a trace. The property that names the
defect, `NoPrematureDelete`, quantifies over parts entering `Deleting`, and only `CleanupGrab` moves a part
there. `CleanupGrab`, `CleanupValidate`, `CleanupDeleteOk` and `CleanupDeleteFail` are still `FALSE` in
`Server.tla`, so `MC_SetSnapshot` cannot reach a single `Deleting` part and the property has nothing to
falsify; it is therefore not in `MC_SetSnapshot.cfg`. The scenario is green on everything it does check. What
task 1 does establish by running is the defect's mechanism, one layer below the property:

- `witness.sh SetSnapshot Assert_getOldestSnapshot` is red, at 442,867 distinct states in 5 seconds. The witness is `SetSnapshot` also moving
  `protected_snapshot` and the `snapshots_in_use` entry, which is the fix; the model's tid-ordered proxy for
  the C++ sortedness assertion is what goes red under it, not the C++ assertion. It confirms that the
  scenario reaches a state in which one running transaction's read snapshot is below another's, which is the
  precondition of the whole defect.
- `witness.sh SetSnapshot Assert_TailPtrNotRegressing Assert_getOldestSnapshot` is red, at 568,869 distinct states in 6 seconds: once the entry does
  move down, the very next `removeOldEntries` computes a `getOldestSnapshot` below the `tail_ptr` it has
  already stored, which is the `LOGICAL_ERROR` at `src/Interpreters/TransactionLog.cpp:312`. That is the
  reason the fix must also refuse a target below `tail_ptr`, and it is why the fix variant carries that
  refusal.
- `MC_SetSnapshotFixed`, the same scenario with `SET_SNAPSHOT_PROTECTS = TRUE`, is green on every property
  `MC_SetSnapshot` checks, so the variant that encodes the fix does not break anything the baseline holds.
  That run is at `TID_MAX = 2`, where it explores 7,291,861 distinct states in 63 seconds; at the committed
  bounds neither scenario finishes, which is model defect M4.

**What task 2 owes this entry**: `CleanupGrab` and its siblings, `NoPrematureDelete`, `PinnedNotDeleted` and
`NoLostVisibleData` added to `MC_SetSnapshot.cfg`, and the run. The expected outcome is red on
`NoPrematureDelete` in `MC_SetSnapshot` and green in `MC_SetSnapshotFixed`; the trace belongs in
`traces/` and its state count and action sequence belong in the row above. If the baseline run is green
instead, the prediction below is wrong and that is the finding.

**The mechanism.** `InterpreterTransactionControlQuery::executeSetSnapshot`
(`src/Interpreters/InterpreterTransactionControlQuery.cpp:138`) validates the requested CSN and calls
`MergeTreeTransaction::setSnapshot` (`src/Interpreters/MergeTreeTransaction.cpp:52`), whose whole body is

```cpp
void MergeTreeTransaction::setSnapshot(CSN new_snapshot)
{
    snapshot.store(new_snapshot, std::memory_order_relaxed);
}
```

The transaction holds `snapshot_in_use_it`, an iterator into `TransactionLog::snapshots_in_use`, set once by
`beginTransaction`. `setSnapshot` does not touch it, so the list keeps the snapshot the transaction started
with. `TransactionLog::getOldestSnapshot` (`src/Interpreters/TransactionLog.cpp:677`) returns
`snapshots_in_use.front()`, which is therefore above the snapshot the transaction actually reads at.

From there the part is lost in three steps. `VersionMetadata::canBeRemoved`
(`src/Interpreters/MergeTreeTransaction/VersionMetadata.cpp:272`) compares the removal CSN against
`getOldestSnapshot` and answers `true` for a part removed after the lowered snapshot but before the protected
one. `MergeTreeData::grabOldParts` (`src/Storages/MergeTree/MergeTreeData.cpp:4140`) asks exactly that
question, and on `true` moves the part out of `Outdated` and schedules its directory for removal. The running
transaction's next `SELECT` then loses the rows it could read a moment earlier, which is the isolation
guarantee `SET TRANSACTION SNAPSHOT` exists to provide.

`getOldestSnapshot` also feeds `removeOldEntries` (`src/Interpreters/TransactionLog.cpp:308`), so the same
too-high value lets the log entries of that era be truncated while a transaction is still reading at a
snapshot below the new `tail_ptr`.

**Proposed fix, applicable to upstream `master`.** Give `TransactionLog` a method that changes a running
transaction's snapshot, and have `executeSetSnapshot` call it instead of `MergeTreeTransaction::setSnapshot`:

- under `running_list_mutex`, refuse with `INVALID_TRANSACTION` when the requested snapshot is below
  `tail_ptr`, because the log entries needed to resolve the parts of that era may already be gone and
  `assertTIDIsNotOutdated` would raise a `LOGICAL_ERROR` on the first lookup that needs one;
- otherwise erase the transaction's `snapshot_in_use_it` from `snapshots_in_use`, re-insert the new value at
  the position it sorts to, store the returned iterator back into `snapshot_in_use_it`, and only then store
  the new value into `snapshot`.

`getOldestSnapshot` then returns `snapshots_in_use.front()` as before, and both of its `chassert`s still hold:
the list keeps one entry per running transaction, and re-inserting at the sorted position keeps it sorted.
Every consumer of `getOldestSnapshot`, `canBeRemoved` and `removeOldEntries` among them, is protected without
being changed.

**The model variant.** `SET_SNAPSHOT_PROTECTS` in `Types.tla` is that fix: `SetSnapshot` in `Server.tla` moves
`protected_snapshot` and the `snapshots_in_use` entry with the snapshot, and refuses a target below
`tlog.tail_ptr`. It necessarily makes the tid order stop being the list order, which is why the sortedness
clause of `Assert_getOldestSnapshot` is conditioned on `~SET_SNAPSHOT_PROTECTS`: under the fix the C++ list is
re-sorted at insertion and the assertion holds, while the model's tid-ordered proxy for it does not. The other
two clauses, the equal membership and the per-entry equality, are checked under both variants.

### F1 in full {#f1}

Trace: `traces/atomicity-own-removal.txt`, 50 states, found after 7,982,042 distinct states.

In the final state `h.committed = {1, 2}`, `h.creating = <<{P1}, {P2}, {}>>`, `h.removing = <<{}, {P1}, {P2}>>`,
`h.csn[2] = 35`, `txn[3].snapshot = 35`, and `client[k1].last_read.parts = {}`. The reader is `t3`. Take the
committed writer `u = 2`: `h.loaded[2]` holds and `h.csn[2] = 35 <= 35`, so the clause applies. `C` was
`h.creating[2] \ h.removing[2] = {P2}`, unfiltered because `h.removers[P2]` is empty, and `Rm` was `{P1}`. With
`V = {}` neither branch holds: `C \subseteq V` fails on `P2`, `Rm \subseteq V` fails on `P1`. Red.

Both parts are invisible to `t3`, and both for reasons the C++ spells out.

`P1` is invisible because a committed removal precedes the reader's snapshot. Its record is
`ctid 1, ccsn 34, rtid 2, rcsn 0`. `VersionInfo::isVisible`
(`src/Interpreters/MergeTreeTransaction/VersionInfo.cpp:138`) falls through its fast path and returns
`std::nullopt`, so `VersionMetadata::isVisible`
(`src/Interpreters/MergeTreeTransaction/VersionMetadata.cpp:46`) looks the removal TID up.
`TransactionLog::getCSN(removal_tid)` answers 35, because `t2` has already written its log entry, and the
closing expression at `VersionMetadata.cpp:100` requires `snapshot_version < current_removal_csn`, which
`35 < 35` fails. That is correct and intended: as far as the log is concerned `t2` is committed, and the log is
the only thing the reader can ask.

`P2` is invisible because the reader is itself removing it. Its record is `ctid 2, ccsn 35, rtid 3, rcsn 0` and
`t3` is the reader, so `VersionInfo::isVisible` reaches the own-removal clause first:

```cpp
    if (creation_csn && snapshot_version < creation_csn)
        return false;
    if (removal_csn && removal_csn <= snapshot_version)
        return false;
    if (!current_tid.isEmpty() && removal_tid == current_tid)
        return false;
```

`VersionInfo.cpp:167-172`. The third test fires and returns `false` before control ever reaches the creation
clause at `:178-183`, where `creation_csn = 35 <= 35` with an empty `removal_tid` would have made the part
visible. Own removal wins over visible creation. That is the same precedence `ReadYourWrites` already states,
and the same one the design document's `Atomicity` row already cites for the writer's own removals.

The remaining question was whether the model should have let `t3` lock `P2` at all, with `t2` still parked in
`CommitStoreCreation` and not yet done writing `ccsn` onto everything it created. It should. A transactional
removal runs `MergeTreeTransaction::removeOldPart` (`src/Interpreters/MergeTreeTransaction.cpp:213`), which
calls `lockRemovalTID` and then `setAndStoreRemovalTID` with no check on the creator at all. The one
creation-committed refusal nearby is on the non-transactional path only: the
`tid.isNonTransactional() && isCreatedByUncommittedTransaction()` guard in `setAndStoreRemovalTID`
(`VersionMetadata.cpp:172`) and the matching throw in `NonTransactionalRemovalLocks::lock`
(`MergeTreeTransaction.cpp:139`). Even that guard would not have fired here, because
`isCreatedByUncommittedTransaction` (`VersionMetadata.cpp:137`) asks `TransactionLog::getCSN(creation_tid)`,
which already answers 35 for `t2`, so the creation counts as committed. `lockRemovalTID`
(`VersionMetadata.cpp:195`) itself refuses only on a non-zero `removal_csn` or a lost compare-and-exchange, and
`P2` had neither.

So the read of `{}` is what the server returns, and the property was the thing that was wrong. `C` is the set of
`u`'s creations the reader must see, and a part the reader is dropping in its own transaction is not one of
them, for exactly the reason the row already gives for `u`'s own removals. The clause now reads

```
C == { p \in h.creating[u] \ h.removing[u] :
         /\ ~\E r \in h.removers[p] \ {u} : h.csn[r] <= s
         /\ p \notin h.removing[t] }
```

in `AtomicityStep`. A collected copy of the isolation properties, the operator `ReadOK`, carried the same
clause until the final review of plan 1 deleted it: no `.cfg` named it and no operator used it, so TLC never
evaluated it and a correction applied to one copy and not the other would have been silent. Nothing else moved. The `Rm \subseteq V` branch, the
`V \cap Rm = {}` branch and the `V \cap (h.creating[u] \cap h.removing[u]) = {}` conjunct are untouched, and the
`Atomicity` witness is still red, so the property still has teeth.

## 2. Model defects and where they get fixed {#model-defects}

| Id | Defect | Effect if left | Placement |
|---|---|---|---|
| M1 | `LegacyPartRecord` gives a legacy part `mem.sv = 0` (`Parts.tla:26`) while its disk record is `Legacy` (`Disk.tla:20`), which is not `Info`, so `DiskHasInfo` is false (`Disk.tla:42`) and `StoredRecord` falls back to `EmptyInfo` with `sv = -1` (`Parts.tla:128`) | Every store on a legacy part compares an expected `-1` against a tentative `sv` of 0 in `StorePersistStep` (`Parts.tla:153`), takes the `TOO_OLD_VERSION` branch, retries `MAX_STORE_RETRIES` times and ends in `STALE_VERSION`. No legacy part can ever be written, so plan 3's `Crash` runs with a non-empty `LEGACY_PARTS` would be vacuous | plan 3, the task that enables `LEGACY_PARTS` |
| M4 | `MC_SetSnapshot` does not finish at the bounds the scenario matrix gives it: four runs at `TID_MAX = 3`, `CSN_MAX = 36` were killed, the last at 56,968,754 distinct states after 8 minutes with 4.47 million still queued. The scenario is 3.4 times `Base` at equal bounds, which puts it near 98 million and about 15 minutes | A scenario that cannot be run is a scenario that checks nothing, and the two reduced bounds that do finish both fail the witness contract: `TID_MAX = 2` turns `Assert_getOldestSnapshot`, `SingleRemover`, `NoUncommittedRead` and `NoLostRead` green, and one session turns `Assert_getOldestSnapshot` green because two transactions are never running together. The committed configuration is therefore the matrix bounds, checked by its witnesses and not by a completed run | the task that owns the state-space budget. The measurements, the three reductions that were applied and the one that was measured and rejected are in `STATE_SPACE.md`, section "The `SetSnapshot` scenario" |
| M3 | `UpdRemoveOldEntriesDelete` re-reads `tlog.tid_to_csn` and `tlog.latest_snapshot` on every iteration, while `TransactionLog::removeOldEntries` (`src/Interpreters/TransactionLog.cpp:319-323`) snapshots both once and then loops over the copy | `latest_snapshot` only grows, so the model can delete an entry the C++ would have kept as "the latest one we fetched". The behaviour set is widened, not narrowed, which is safe for every property of plan 2: the only property that reads `h.truncated` is `LogEntryNeeded`, which is plan 3's | plan 3, the task that enables `Crash`, either narrows this to a snapshotted set or argues the widening is still sound for `LogEntryNeeded` |
| M2 | `StmtRollbackMark` and `StmtRollbackDrop` acted on `stmt.precommitted \ stmt.attached`, and `Refuse` routed to them only when that difference was non-empty (`Server.tla`, the statement-rollback actions) | The statement rollback skipped a part that `addNewPartAndRemoveCovered` had already attached to the outer transaction, where `MergeTreeData::Transaction::rollback` (`src/Storages/MergeTree/MergeTreeData.cpp:11122`) marks and removes every part of `precommitted_parts`; and a `Refuse` whose precommitted set was entirely attached left the `stmt` record standing, so the leak outlived the statement. Both are dead in `Base`, which has `QUERY_FAULTS_MAX = 0` and an empty `Covers`, so neither `Fail` nor `PublishEnrol` can refuse with a non-empty `stmt.precommitted`; plan 2 gives the sibling scenario a covering relation, which makes `PublishEnrol` live and a `SERIALIZATION_ERROR` between `PublishStart` and `PublishFlip` reachable, and both would have gone live there at once | closed by the final-review fix commit of plan 1 |

`M2` was closed rather than placed. `Refuse` now routes to `StmtRollbackMark` whenever `stmt.precommitted` is non-empty, which is what `MergeTreeData::Transaction::isEmpty` (`src/Storages/MergeTree/MergeTreeData.h:391`) tests, and both statement-rollback actions act on the whole of `stmt.precommitted`. The attached part keeps its entry in `txn[t].creating` and in `h.creating[t]`, because `MergeTreeTransaction::creating_parts` keeps its entry too; `Refuse` always ends at the outer rollback, and that rollback's second stamp of `RolledBackCSN` and second removal from the working set are both no-ops in the C++ and in the model. The entry `README.md`, section 8, used to carry for this divergence is gone with it. Nothing in `Base` changed state: the count stayed at the figure the run table records, for the reason the row above gives.

The C++ settles which side of the comparison is wrong. A part with no `txn_version.txt` is loaded by
`VersionMetadataOnDisk::loadMetadata` (`src/Interpreters/MergeTreeTransaction/VersionMetadataOnDisk.cpp:49`),
which on the no-file path returns a default-constructed `VersionInfo` carrying only
`creation_tid = Tx::NonTransactionalTID` and `creation_csn = Tx::NonTransactionalCSN`. Its `storing_version`
keeps the member default, `VersionInfo::UNSTORED_VERSION = -1`
(`src/Interpreters/MergeTreeTransaction/VersionInfo.h:20,23`). The other side of the comparison,
`getExpectedStoringVersionUnlocked` (`VersionMetadataOnDisk.cpp:247`), also returns `UNSTORED_VERSION` when the
file does not exist. Both sides are `-1`, and the first store goes through.

So the model's `mem` is the wrong side, not `StoredRecord`. The fix is to drop the `!.sv = 0` from
`LegacyPartRecord` and let it keep `EmptyInfo`'s `-1`, which is what `loadMetadata` produces. Giving the disk
record a stored `sv` of 0 instead would contradict the C++, where a legacy part has nothing persisted at all.

## 3. Spec defects {#spec-defects}

Rows of `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-17-mergetree-transactions-tla-design.md` that the model contradicts,
with the correction the next revision folds in.

| Id | Spec row | What is wrong | Correction |
|---|---|---|---|
| S1 | `Atomicity`, section "Invariants and properties" | `C` is built from the parts the writer created and did not itself remove, minus those a later committed transaction visible to the reader removed. It never subtracts the reader's own uncommitted removals, although the precedence it cites for the writer, own removal over visible creation, is the reader's too: `VersionInfo::isVisible` returns false on `removal_tid == current_tid` (`VersionInfo.cpp:171`) before reaching the creation clause at `:178`. Counterexample F1 | Add to `C` the condition that `p` is not in the reader's own `h_removing`. `Atomicity` in `Invariants.tla` already carries it |
| S2 | the `NoAvoidableTermination` witness row | The row names scenario `Base`, but the witness it describes needs a `Fail` inside `afterCommit` that takes the server down, which requires `ProcessDown`, an action `Base` does not enable. `WITNESSES.md` defers the witness to plan 5. One of the two statements has to give | Move the row's scenario to the first one that enables `ProcessDown`. The property itself stays in `Base`, where it is checked but not yet falsifiable |
| S3 | `UpdLoadEntriesMap`, section "Updating thread" | The row puts the action at "`loadEntries` up to the `NOEXCEPT_SCOPE_STRICT` block", and then says that block is where the batch enters `tid_to_csn` under `TransactionLog::mutex`. The two halves contradict each other, and the code settles it: `TransactionLog::loadEntries` (`src/Interpreters/TransactionLog.cpp:161`) fills `tid_to_csn` and advances `last_loaded_entry` *inside* the `NOEXCEPT_SCOPE_STRICT` block, and only the block after it, under `running_list_mutex` (`:174`), moves `latest_snapshot`. An action that stopped before the block would publish nothing | Restate the boundary as "`loadEntries` through the `NOEXCEPT_SCOPE_STRICT` block". `README.md`, section 3, carries the corrected row |
| S4 | `CommitError`, section "Client and session" | The row attributes the `INVALID_TRANSACTION` of a `COMMIT` on a cancelled transaction to `beforeCommit`. `InterpreterTransactionControlQuery::executeCommit` (`src/Interpreters/InterpreterTransactionControlQuery.cpp:64`) refuses it earlier, on `getState() != RUNNING`, before `commitTransaction` is called at all, and that is the guard the model's action has. `beforeCommit`'s failed compare-and-exchange (`src/Interpreters/MergeTreeTransaction.cpp:308`) raises the same error only for a kill that lands after the interpreter's guard | Name the interpreter guard as the action's site and `beforeCommit` as the racing one. `README.md`, section 3, carries the corrected row |
| S5 | `AckedWriteIsDurable`, section "Invariants and properties" | The row admits a created part in `Outdated` only when the removal is committed, `h_removers[p] /= {}`. `DropOutdate` outdates a part under the parts lock, long before the transaction that drops it commits, so a part created by an acknowledged transaction and dropped by a still-running one is `Outdated` with no committed remover, and the literal row is red on the baseline. `Invariants.tla` therefore also admits a removal merely in flight, `part[p].lock /= EmptyTID`. The row's antecedent is also `h_effects`, which includes mutations, while the property tested only `h.creating` and `h.removing` | Admit an in-flight removal in the row, with the `DropOutdate` boundary as the reason. `Invariants.tla` carries the relaxation and cites this id; its antecedent now includes `h.mutations`, and `FlipAfterStoresStep` carries the row's mutation conjunct, both vacuous while `Mutations = {}` |
| S6 | the `SetSnapshot` row of the scenario matrix | The row lists `NoOutdatedLookup` among the properties the `SetSnapshot` scenario checks. `assertTIDIsNotOutdated` (`src/Interpreters/TransactionLog.cpp:656`) has exactly two call sites: `tryFinalizeUnknownStateTransactions` (`:387`), which is the action `UpdFinalizeUnknown`, and `getCSNAndAssert` (`:645`), which has no caller anywhere in the tree. The `SetSnapshot` scenario is `Base` plus `SetSnapshot`, the cleanup group and the updater's GC group, and enables neither, so the property is vacuous there whatever the trace. Its own witness row names scenario `Keeper`, which does enable the unknown-state group, so the two rows of the document disagree | Drop `NoOutdatedLookup` from the `SetSnapshot` row and keep it in `Keeper` and `SnapshotCrash`, which enable `UpdFinalizeUnknown`. `NoOutdatedLookup` is defined in `Invariants.tla` and is not in `MC_SetSnapshot.cfg`; `WITNESSES.md` records the vacuous run |

Two more rows of the "Client and session" table are coarser than the model rather than wrong: `DropStart`
bundles `stopMergesAndWait`, the wait, `lockParts` and the selection of the visible parts into one row, which the
model splits into `DropStart` and `DropLock` because the wait is where another session's work interleaves; and
`StmtRollback` is one row for the two halves of `MergeTreeData::Transaction::rollback`, the per-part
`setAndStoreCreationCSN(RolledBackCSN)` before the parts lock and the state change under it, which the model
splits into `StmtRollbackMark` and `StmtRollbackDrop` for the same reason. The design document's own rule is
"one function or one step of a function", so neither split contradicts it and neither is filed above.

### A spec row that was wrongly doubted {#withdrawn}

The `validateInfo, removal` witness row was on this list until the bounds changed, and it comes off it.

The row names one change, "`DropStore` skipped". At `TID_MAX = 2` that change alone left the run green, and the
witness was built as a two-change one, the second change stopping `EnrolBody` (`Server.tla:189`) from starting
the removal-TID store at all. `WITNESSES.md` described the two-change witness and both of its minimality halves
were green, so the row looked wrong.

At `TID_MAX = 3` the half that applies the wait change alone is red: 53,133,545 distinct states, and the trace
is exactly the shape the row names. `t2` locks `P1`, starts the removal-TID store, and returns from
`removeOldPart` without waiting for it; `t2` is then rolled back, which clears the removal TID; `t3` takes the
lock, commits, and `CommitStoreRemoval` computes a removal CSN of 35 for a record whose `rtid` is still empty,
which `validateInfo` rejects. Three transactions are the fewest that can build it, which is why two changes
looked necessary at two.

So the row was right and the model's witness was over-specified. `Assert_validateInfo_removal` is now the
one-change witness the row names, the `_only1` and `_only2` hooks are gone with the minimality check they
existed for, and nothing is owed to the next spec revision here.

### `RollbackNoLeak` and `KillerNotStranded` {#properties-without-a-row}

`RollbackNoLeak`, added by task 1, and `KillerNotStranded`, added by task 3, are both in `MC_Base.cfg`'s
`INVARIANTS` list without a witness, which the witness contract does not allow. They are not the same case.

`RollbackNoLeak` does have a spec row. The design document's `RollbackRestores` row states two things: the
action property on `RollbackFinalize`, which `RollbackRestoresStep` implements, and, "as a state invariant, no
part of `h_creating[t]` is ever in the visible-parts set of a read by a transaction other than `t`".
`RollbackNoLeak` is that second half, stated more strongly: the model quantifies over every transaction that is
not in `h.committed`, not only over the rolled-back ones the row speaks of. So it is rostered, and what it owes
is a witness of its own rather than a row. A witness is writable within `Base`, a rollback that leaves a created
part visible to another session's read, and it belongs with the plan that next touches the rollback actions.

`KillerNotStranded` appears nowhere in the design document: not as a property, not as a witness row. The ruling
recorded here is that it stays. It states something the model would otherwise not check at all, it holds on
every baseline run, and removing it would lose coverage to satisfy a bookkeeping rule. What the next spec
revision owes it is a row, with the witness that row implies: a rollback step that starts and never completes,
so that a killer parked at `KillWait` is never released. `Base` has no such step, so that witness goes to plan 5
alongside the other liveness witnesses.

Until those two witnesses exist, both properties are checked without ever having been shown to be falsifiable.
That is a debt, recorded here and in the gap table of `WITNESSES.md`, not a result.
