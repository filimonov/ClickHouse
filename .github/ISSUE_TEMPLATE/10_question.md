Make sure to check the [Altinity documentation](https://docs.altinity.com/) and the [Altinity Knowledge Base](https://kb.altinity.com/) first. 

If your question is concise and probably has a short answer, asking it in the [the Altinity Slack channel](https://altinitydbworkspace.slack.com/join/shared_invite/zt-1togw9b4g-N0ZOXQyEyPCBh_7IEHUjdw#/shared-invite/email) is probably the fastest way to find the answer. 

For more complicated questions, consider [asking them on StackOverflow with the tag "clickhouse"](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/clickhouse). 

If you'd rather file a GitHub issue, remove all this text and ask your question here.
