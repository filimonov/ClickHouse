# CAS MergeTree — Live Backlog {#cas-backlog}

Live backlog: only open work. History and removed entries live in git; verification record in
`consolidation-2026-08/`.

This file is the **index**. The backlog itself lives in per-topic files under
[`BACKLOG/`](BACKLOG/), split 2026-08-04 so a reader (or grep) can go straight to one subsystem
instead of scanning one flat multi-hundred-item file. Item format is uniform:
`- **[id] Title** — PRIORITY — 1-3 lines: current status / the open ask / evidence pointer` (a few
genuinely-live long designs keep structured detail below their header line instead of being
compressed). Issue IDs are never renumbered.

**Blob-publication baseline since 2026-08-23.** Every blob decision begins with `HEAD`; an absent or
`Condemned` body is published unconditionally, while metadata/control objects retain native
conditional operations for create-if-absent and conditional replacement. The [real-storage gate](/superpowers/cas/unconditional-blob-publication-live-results)
and [performance gate](/superpowers/cas/unconditional-blob-publication-performance) are both still
blocked for the external/evidence reasons recorded in those reports. Backlog text below marked
historical or closed must not be read as the current body-publication API.

Priority legend: **GATE** = release gate; **HARD** = agreed-necessary, not yet done; **DESIRABLE** =
valuable, not committed; **DOC** = documentation debt; **TEST/INFRA** = validation/harness/CI;
**MINOR** = small concrete improvement; **VERIFY** = believed open, confirm before working. These
seven are the canonical set; individual items also carry more specific free-form qualifiers where an
item's author wanted to say something the seven don't capture (`QUESTION`, `DESIGN QUESTION`, `WATCH`,
`GAP`, `INFRA`, `LOW`/`LOW-PRI`, `PARTIAL`, `MEASURED`, `IN PROGRESS`, `TRACKED, by design`, and
similar) — read those as elaborating one of the seven, not as a competing taxonomy.

**2026-08-04 orphaned-open triage merge:** 367 open-verdict clusters from the docs-consolidation
corpus were 4-way classified; 54 effective new/still-open findings (57 minus 3 rechecked and closed
by design) were merged into the topic files above, each marked with a `## New findings from the
2026-08-04 orphaned-open triage` heading; 35 duplicates were folded into their existing matching item
as a confirmation note rather than inserted separately. Full triage record:

### Real-GCS 15-minute soak (2026-09-04, binary 03ccdd795d9) — return items {#gcs-soak-2026-09-04-return-items}

Report: `docs/superpowers/cas/2026-09-04-gcs-soak-15min.md`. Correctness PASS: `dangling=0` on both
checkpoints, the aggregate oracle held (node1 = node2 = model, count 40883), GC's retired pipeline closed
(`CASGCRetiredCondemned = Graduated = Redeleted = 5458`), `GaveUp` 2 (leader) / 1, zero dangling/corrupt
rows in `cas_log`, RSS plateau 1.4–1.7 GB per node. The driver reported FAIL on its final converge
checkpoint ("unreachable never stabilized within 1092 s", history 4909 → 287 strictly monotone) and its
own post-failure fsck already showed `unreachable=0`: a timing miss, not non-convergence.

- **Harness: `fixpoint_timeout_s` assumes a GC round every ~2 s** (`gc_interval_s=2` default) and gave
  1092 s for ~98 rounds; real GCS rounds took 18.8 s to 1250 s (round 7: 1114 s of its 1125 s in
  `pending_deletes`, 5000 throttled deletes). Derive the bound from observed round durations, as
  `wait_for_pool_drain` already does; otherwise every real-GCS soak with a backlog fails falsely.
  **Reproduced on real AWS 2026-09-04** (`ca_live_20260904_aws_r1`, 8-minute no-chaos smoke; read-only
  investigation report in the run's `tmp/aws_unreachable_debug_report.md`): `history=[3517, 2779]`,
  bound 300 s, while the pool converged to `unreachable=0 dangling=0 unaccounted=0` on its own 38
  minutes after the checkpoint started; condemned = graduated = redeleted = 4305, spared/replaced/
  absent 0, every unreachable object a `blobs/` key in `delete_pending` or `awaiting_gc`. Two concrete
  defects in `soak/checker.py`: (1) `poll_unreachable_to_stable` needs `stable=3` samples and each sample
  is a full fsck (~325 s at 4-5k objects), so three samples cannot fit a 300 s bound regardless of GC
  health; (2) `initial` is read before the first condemning round, so `max(300, 0.2 * initial)` collapses
  to the floor while the backlog is still rising; the `wait_for_pool_drain` precondition never engaged
  because `soak.pool`'s physical probe returns `None` on a live store. Fix: bound ≥ `stable` × measured
  fsck seconds plus a drain estimate taken from `pending_reclaim` in `system.cas_mounts` and the observed
  `system.cas_gc_log` round durations. Also: the run JSON's `fsck_status: "skipped"` is misleading when
  three fscks ran and only the final one was not reached.
  Owner: `utils/ca-soak/soak/run.py`.
- **GC round cost on GCS** — the measurement behind `{#gc-manifests-immutable-cheap-reduce}`: five leader
  rounds 1827 s total, `fold_reduce` 1383 s of it; sequential per-object phases (`fold_reduce`,
  `ref_object_cleanup`, `manifest_deletes`, `pending_deletes`) are the whole budget.
- **429 `SlowDown` hot spot on one key per node: the mount-lease checkpoint object
  `cas/ns/state/<mount-id>/_ckpt`** (269 on ch1, 340 on ch2) — GCS's ~1 mutation/s per object; the
  renewer/checkpoint writer exceeds it. Question: can `_ckpt` writes be paced to the object budget or
  coalesced, and does the 429 backoff ever threaten the lease deadline? (Not in this run: no lease loss
  from 429.)
- **DNS resolution outage to `storage.googleapis.com` at 11:07:01–11:08:49Z** (repeated
  `Poco::TimeoutException`/DNS errors, zero 429s in the window) caused a simultaneous lease loss and a
  six-attempt remount storm on BOTH nodes (attempt 7 succeeded) and the 53.9 s lease phase on ch2's
  round 191. The fencing protocol did its job; the item is observability: the remount log should name
  the DNS failure class distinctly, and the host's Docker resolver flakiness is the suspect (unconfirmed
  against host DNS logs).
  Not a storm: the remount attempts were 1.5, 2.5, 4.5, 8.5, 16.5 s apart, then 72 s (attempt 7 succeeded
  once DNS returned) — `CasMountRuntime::remountLoop`'s deterministic doubling backoff 1 s → 30 s cap
  (`backoff_ms = min(backoff_ms * 2, 30000)`), with NO jitter: both nodes lost the lease within 1.4 s of
  each other and retried in lockstep (attempt k at the same second on ch1 and ch2). Harmless with two
  nodes; with N nodes it is the thundering herd jitter exists to break. Small change: draw the remount
  wait from the engine's full-jitter schedule (`Retry::backoff`) instead of the bare doubling.

### `[gc-manifests-are-immutable-so-reduce-and-deletes-can-be-cheap]` The orphan sweep re-reads every listed manifest and deletes manifests one conditional request at a time; manifest keys cannot be reborn, so neither is needed (2026-09-04, user) {#gc-manifests-immutable-cheap-reduce}

Measured on the 15-minute real-GCS soak (leader `ca-live-gcs-ch1-1`, `system.cas_gc_log`, phase rows
joined to `Finish` rows through `round_id`): rounds 1.2 s → 18.8 s → 128 s → 584 s → longer. Round 3 =
`fold_reduce` 380 s (3840 GETs: 2870 `CASGCGet`, 814 `CASRootGet`, 100 `CASManifestGet`; 1966 read
errors), `fold_ref_intake` 46 s, `manifest_deletes` 37 s (188 conditional deletes). Round 4 =
`fold_reduce` 300 s (3002 `CASGCGet`, 2006 errors), `ref_object_cleanup` 204 s (512 keys × HEAD + catalog
GET + gc/state GET + conditional DELETE). Round 5 = `fold_reduce` 587 s (3400 GET + 5383 HEAD, all HEADs
inline: `CASGCReadAheadMiss` 5382, hits 0), `manifest_deletes` 617 s (3250 conditional deletes at ~190 ms).
`orphan_sweep` nominated nothing in any round.

The reduce's `CASGCGet` volume is NOT manifest bodies (those are capped at 100 by
`manifest_sweep_delete_budget_keys`): it is `floorForNamespace` in `prefixEligibleOn`
(`Gc/CasOrphanManifestSweep.cpp:481`), called once per listed manifest because the eligibility memo is
keyed by build prefix and every `INSERT` is its own build; each call reads the mount key of every
`/`-prefix of the namespace (`…/store/465` 404, `…/store` 404, `<root>` hit). 956 × 3 = 2868 ≈ 2870
reads; 956 × 2 + 54 reissues = 1966 errors. Rounds 4 and 5: 1000 × 3 + 2 = 3002, 1000 × 2 + 6 = 2006.

Why the per-key conditional deletes are not needed (user, 2026-09-04): manifest keys, ref `_log` and
`_snap` keys are write-once by construction (`op.create`, epoch/sequence/ordinal monotone, life-qualified;
global manifest-key uniqueness rests on decommission being irreversible). Blobs are NOT write-once and
keep the exact-token delete. GCS accepts batch `DeleteObjects` (the live gate proves it; an earlier note
here claiming the XML API lacks it was wrong). Retirements cannot be taken from the source-edge runs:
`sourceEdgeId` (`Gc/CasBlobInDegree.cpp:164`) is an irreversible hash, so a nominated orphan's body is
still read, bounded by the candidate budget.

Design, `IMPLEMENTED` (2026-09-04) on branch `cas-gc-write-once-keys`:
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-04-cas-gc-immutable-key-round-cost-design.md`
(A: one floor per namespace per page; B: late manifest reads and read-ahead in the sweep; C:
`removeManyWriteOnce` with `manifest_deletes` as consumer; D: ref-cleanup cohorts). Plan:
`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-04-cas-gc-immutable-key-round-cost.md`. Measured on two 2026-09-04
GCS soaks of the implemented binary (`HEAD 0247064fa17`); full figures and the placement/re-scope
notes are in the spec's `#implementation-record`:

| phase | before (morning, old binary) | after |
|---|---|---|
| `fold_reduce`, steady-state round | 300 to 380 s | 2.1 to 4.9 s |
| `manifest_deletes`, round with 1506 keys | 617 s / 3250 keys | 2.0 s, 2 `CASBulkDeleteRequests` |
| `ref_object_cleanup`, round with work | 200 s | 0.6 to 1.4 s |
| `fold_reduce`, mass-removal round | 587 s | 123.4 s (item E: inline `HEAD`s, not this design's target) |

**Investigation item, not part of the design (refined 2026-09-04 with run-2 evidence):** round 5's
5382 inline HEADs was the first sighting. The no-chaos GCS soak reproduced the same pattern from
ordinary workload backlog alone, without chaos and without a scripted cliff: rounds 23-25 show
`CASGCReadAheadMiss` 2534 / 795 / 222 against inline `HEAD` counts 2530 / 793 / 219, and each round's
`Finish` row shows `CASGCReadAheadWasted=64` — exactly one window pinned per round, independent of
round size. Unlike the original sighting, `epoch_crossings=0` on the intake row for all three rounds,
so the epoch-crossing hypothesis is not the only mechanism that pins the shared read-ahead window on
a mass-removal round; something else pins it too. Needs a local reproduction that isolates the
mechanism without a crossing; the fix shape, once found, is still an epoch-crossing-style discard
rule applied at the fold's own hinting site, `Gc/CasGc.cpp:2512`.
A sibling of the same class, found at the final review of the write-once-key branch: the shared
recovery walk (`Pool/CasRefProtocol.cpp`, `recoverRefTableDetailedFromAuthority`) discards hinted
ref-log ids only at a seal, so its `CORRUPTED_DATA` and decode throws leave up to one window pinned,
and `planManifestCursorPage` catches per-namespace throws and keeps using the same reader for the rest
of the page. Throughput only; the `OutstandingHintGuard` shape the sweep's tail walk uses closes it.

### `[gc-sweep-reads-the-committed-tail-twice]` The orphan sweep walks each namespace's committed tail twice per page (2026-09-04) {#gc-sweep-reads-the-committed-tail-twice}

`activeManifestKeys` (`Gc/CasOrphanManifestSweep.cpp`) first recovers the table through
`recoverRefTableDetailedFromAuthority`, which replays every log from the checkpoint base to the
committed frontier, then walks the same range again itself to collect tail-removal targets. On the
GCS soak both walks read each epoch-2 log once, so every ref log the sweep touches costs two GETs,
and an epoch crossing costs two windows of read-ahead waste instead of one (the `wasted=127`
rows). The recovery already decodes every transaction; collecting the `-1` manifest edges during that
replay would remove the second walk. Small, GC-internal, no protocol change; measure with the sweep's
`CASRootGet` on the reduce row (814 per round on the 2026-09-04 GCS soak before A to D, still two
per log after).


### `[soak-harness-needsrecovery-after-near-ttl-pause]` The soak harness treats a near-TTL chaos pause's designed fence-then-recover as a fatal violation (2026-09-04) {#soak-harness-needsrecovery-after-near-ttl-pause}

GCS soak run 1 (`ca_live_20260904_r2`, phase 3, chaos): chaos fault #4 was `both pause` for 29 s
against a 30 s mount-lease TTL. `ch2`'s renewer fenced (`external_lease_deadline`, 0 physical
attempts), its ref append lane went `CASRefNeedsRecovery` at the committed-frontier publication
fence, and the harness's recovery checkpoint treats any nonzero `CASRefNeedsRecovery` as a
"LATE-PUT FENCING VIOLATION" and aborts the driver. The data model matched byte-for-byte on both
nodes (count 62496, same `sum_fp`/`uniq_keys`/`sum_v`/`sum_version`) and fsck came back clean
(`dangling=0 unreachable=0 stale_edge=0`); `system.cas_log` shows `ch2` recovered normally
(`mount_remount ok`) once the pause ended. `CASRefNeedsRecovery` is a cumulative counter: one
genuine, expected recovery event during a designed near-TTL pause keeps it nonzero in every later
snapshot by construction, which is what "stays 1 across three ticks" actually means here, not a
stuck lane. Ruled not attributable to the branch under measurement (`cas-gc-write-once-keys`): no
file it touches sits on the mount renewer or the ref append lane. Fix options for the harness: (a)
classify a chaos pause whose duration is within 1 s of the lease TTL as `freeze_long` rather than
an ordinary pause, since a fence-then-recover is the designed outcome at that margin; or (b) drop
`CASRefNeedsRecovery` from the must-stay-zero counter set at the recovery checkpoint specifically
for the case where the lane has since remounted and the data model matches, since the counter
cannot distinguish "recovered once, correctly" from "still stuck" without also reading the mount
state.

### `[gc-blob-pending-deletes-now-dominant]` With A-D landed, serial exact-token blob deletes are the largest remaining GC phase on a mass-removal round (2026-09-04) {#gc-blob-pending-deletes-now-dominant}

GCS soak run 2 (`ca_live_20260904_r3`, phase 3, `--no-chaos`): round 25's `pending_deletes` phase
alone took 551.5 s for 2731 blobs — one `HEAD` plus one conditional `DELETE` per blob, serial
(about 100 ms each) — against `fold_reduce` 14.7 s, `manifest_deletes` 0.22 s and
`ref_object_cleanup` 0.22 s in the same round. This is now the largest single-phase cost this
design's rounds show, larger than any of the phases A-D target. Blobs stay exact-token by design
(I5: a condemned blob key can be re-uploaded by a writer, so the exact-token delete is what keeps
that resurrection safe; blobs are explicitly out of `removeManyWriteOnce`'s scope). The lever is
already on this list: `[gc-delete-concurrency-serial]`.

### `[cas-transient-lease-fence-surfaces-to-clients]` A transient mount-lease fence surfaces to synchronous client calls as `NETWORK_ERROR` (2026-09-04) {#cas-transient-lease-fence-surfaces-to-clients}

Local CA-s3 stateless lane, run 2 (`docs/superpowers/cas/2026-09-04-stateless-lane-triage.md`, 11137
tests): under the same S3-endpoint saturation that produces the PUT-timeout class, the renewer logged
`CAS mount renewal 'stateless-ca-s3' fenced after 3 physical attempts in 9068 ms
(classification=external_lease_deadline)`; 371 "mount lease not held" lines followed, almost all
background retries that self-healed (drop retries, merge-tree executor), but two tests surfaced the
window to a synchronous client call and failed with `Code: 210 … mount lease not held`:
`01128_generate_random_nested` (the INSERT path's ref-log append: "NEEDS RECOVERY at committed-frontier
publication fence") and `02581_share_big_sets_between_mutation_tasks` (`StorageMergeTree::waitForMutation`).
The fence itself is correct and fail-close (unit-tested at `CasServerRoot.cpp`, `gtest_cas_heartbeat.cpp`,
`gtest_cas_pool.cpp`). The open question is client-facing semantics: whether a query that hits a
CAS-transient fence should wait for the remount (bounded by the query's own timeout) rather than fail
with `NETWORK_ERROR`, and where that wait belongs (the ref-lane append, `waitForMutation`, or a
disk-level "mount recovering" retry). Needs a design call, not a mechanical fix; frequency 2/11137 on
this lane.

Measured frequencies from the same run for the recorded items: PUT-timeout Error log
(`{#cas-s3-lane-put-timeout-logged-at-error}`) 42/11137; ref-catalog starvation
(`{#ref-catalog-cas-starvation}`) 1/11137. Class B (404 on stderr) = 0 after 6830b73af27.

### `[snapshot-publish-error-hook-busy-loop]` An exception before any write-failure arm in the background snapshot publisher redispatches with no backoff (2026-09-04) {#snapshot-publish-error-hook-busy-loop}

**FIXED 2026-09-04 in b3ac09f1c6f:** the detached task's `catch (...)` in `dispatchSnapshotPublisher` now arms `advancePublishBackoff` under `state_mutex` before the error hook runs (the only site that knows an exception escaped; `settleSnapshotPublish` carries no outcome). Red-first: `CASDetachedWork.ThrowingPublishAttemptIsPacedByTheBackoff` — 6,921,818 attempts in 300 s on the old code, 513 ms green after. The remount-path wall clock at `Pool/CasPool.cpp:1258` that the fix report flagged is stamping-only and never enters the reclaim or fence decisions (those read the injectable clocks) — not a trap, nothing to do.

`CasRefLedger::dispatchSnapshotPublisher`'s detached task's outer `catch (...)` (`CasRefLedger.cpp`,
around the `dispatch_detached` call) never arms `advancePublishBackoff` — every OTHER exit from
`tryPublishSnapshotAndAdvanceCheckpointOnceOnRuntimeImpl` (a non-`Committed` write, an encode
failure, a checkpoint that fails to advance) does, before returning `false`. `settleSnapshotPublish`
re-evaluates `admitSnapshotPublishUnderStateLock` on every settlement, and its only pacing gate is
the backoff deadline (`now >= rt.publish_backoff_until_ms`) — so an exception reaching the outer
`catch` without one of those ordinary arms having run first (any exception thrown before the
write attempt itself — an encode setup bug, an assertion, anything unanticipated) causes the ledger
to redispatch at full speed, forever, since the tail count that made it over-threshold is never
cleared either. Measured directly: `1,263,317` redispatches in 30 real seconds, one core pegged. It
stops only because `Pool::tryRemountOnce`'s mount-lease check uses real `std::chrono::system_clock`
(not the injectable boot clock the rest of the engine reads), so the real default 30000ms
`mount_lease_ttl_ms` eventually elapses and fences the mount closed. A test that reproduces this
exact path deterministically, without a real 30s spin, is `CASDetachedWork
.SettlementSurvivesAThrowingErrorHandler` (`src/Disks/tests/gtest_cas_detached_work.cpp`) with its
`snapshot_after_capture_hook_for_test` re-armed persistently instead of self-disarming after one
throw. Fix shape: arm `advancePublishBackoff` in `dispatchSnapshotPublisher`'s outer `catch (...)`
(or in `settleSnapshotPublish` before a redispatch) so ANY exception paces the same as an ordinary
write failure. This is a lease/ledger production-path change and needs review before it is made, not
something to fix opportunistically alongside an unrelated task.

### `[stateless-lane-wall-time-is-drop-table]` Measured on the CA-s3 stateless lane (2026-09-04): DROP TABLE is the suite's largest wall-time sink; the server is not CPU-bound {#stateless-lane-wall-time-is-drop-table}

`system.trace_log` over ten minutes of the parallel suite (~10 jobs): ~280 CPU samples against 630k
Real samples — the server is waiting, not computing; 21% of the CPU samples are stack unwinding and
symbolisation for exceptions (every expected 412/404/timeout builds a full `StackTrace`). Query threads'
Real samples: 44% waiting in `InterpreterDropQuery::executeToTable` for the synchronous data drop, 25%
in `TaskTracker::waitAll` under `fanOutBlobUploads`/`commit`/`moveDirectory` (the part-commit round
trips), 14% in `finalizeConditionalWrite` (conditional PUT wait), 13% in `poll`. `system.query_log`,
same window: DROP TABLE n=1436 p50 2.4 s p90 11.9 s max 34.7 s; CREATE TABLE p50 184 ms p90 391 ms;
INSERT p50 253 ms p90 541 ms. S3 calls: GET 11 095, HEAD 2 966, PUT 1 597, LIST 206, DELETE 25.
The background drop workers themselves sit in a futex inside `DatabaseCatalog::dropTableDataTask`, not
in S3 — the drop chain is serialised somewhere (the namespace removal through the hot `ref_catalog`
door with the conflict backoff up to 5 s fits the p90/max shape). Placement: profile one DROP on the CA
disk (S3 operations and CAS conflicts per dropped table) as the first measurement of the
`{#ref-catalog-cas-starvation}` follow-up; second target = the part-commit round trips (upload fan-out
+ conditional PUTs); third = skip `StackTrace` capture for expected 412s.

Design for the first target: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-04-cas-hot-key-write-lane-design.md`
(revision 34, phase A, 2026-09-04; accepted by the codex review of revision 33 with no CRITICAL or MAJOR), which supersedes the fix sketch below where they differ; the
deferred phase B is `{#hot-key-lane-phase-b}`.

### `[ref-catalog-cas-starvation-under-parallel-writers]` One process's CREATE/DROP writers starve each other on the ref-catalog compare-and-swap (2026-09-04) {#ref-catalog-cas-starvation}

Seen on the local CA-s3 stateless lane (run 2, ~10 parallel jobs): `01039_mergetree_exec_time`'s
`CREATE TABLE` failed after 78.9 s with "CAS ref catalog update: gave up at the policy deadline". RCA in
`docs/superpowers/cas/2026-09-04-ref-catalog-starvation-rca.md`: 113 `PreconditionFailed` (412) on
`cas_s3/cas/ref_catalog` in 80 s from 53 threads; the losing writer made 35 attempts spaced by the
engine's full-jitter backoff (up to the 5 s cap) while fresh writers, starting at attempt 1, kept
winning about once a second; successful `CREATE TABLE` in the window: p50 203 ms, p90 457 ms, max 10.4 s.
`readModifyWrite` routes a `Conflict` into the same `pauseAndReissue`/`Retry::backoff` schedule and the
same `reissues` counter as a transport fault; the spec prescribes exactly that ("conflicts spend the same
budget as errors", motivated by GCS's ~1 write/s per-object budget) but never analyses fairness among
many independent writers on one hot key. Pre-migration, the catalog loop retried a conflict at once,
capped at 100 attempts. Verdict: spec-conformant, unfair by construction under sustained arrivals.

DROP TABLE is the same starvation, measured on one 33.6 s drop (table `6f6ae69d…`, two parts): the
query waited 18 s in the drop queue behind other drops, `dropAllData` then spent 1.0 s on two
`delete_tmp` ref repoints (~0.5 s per part) and **15.4 s in "removing table directory recursive"**,
which is ONE namespace-removal conditional write on `ref_catalog` that lost eight races in a row
(`WriteBufferFromS3 was canceled` at +0.03, +0.21, +0.37, +0.71, +1.8, +4.5, +8.1, +12.3 s — the
growing conflict backoff) before landing; the worker thread then immediately took the next table.
Sixteen drop workers were active, all bottlenecked on that one key: drops complete in bursts of ~10 per
5 s with gaps. The query thread itself issues zero S3/CAS calls (all per-query counters are 0); it only
waits. So a DROP is, as designed, one catalog write plus one ref write per part — and the catalog
write is what costs seconds.

Fix, two halves, in this order:

1. **Serialize within a process and remember the last committed state (user's proposal, primary).**
   Compare-and-swap is needed only against other servers. Inside one server every catalog mutation
   takes one FIFO door per pool in `CasRefCatalog`: one write at a time, no combining. The door keeps
   the last COMMITTED snapshot and its etag from the previous successful write, applies the next change
   to that snapshot and issues the conditional PUT against the remembered etag — no read before the
   write. Only a lost race (another server's write, a 412 that the engine settles by its resolve read)
   refreshes the remembered state from `Conflict::seen` and retries; any outcome that does not prove
   what is durable (`GaveUp`, `Conflict{NotObserved}`, a fence loss or remount) invalidates the memory,
   so the next writer reads first — fail-close. GC, the reconciler and decommission take the same door,
   otherwise their writes stale the memory and cost one extra round trip each. Effect on this lane: N
   concurrent `CREATE`s become N sequential PUTs with no reads and no intra-process 412s. Tests: N
   threads on the in-memory backend under an injected clock — at most one CAS in flight, FIFO order,
   zero reads between consecutive committed writes, bounded maximum wait; and a second `Pool` on the
   same backend as the external writer whose win forces exactly one re-read and one retry.
2. **Decouple conflict pacing from transport-fault backoff (secondary, spec change).** A `Conflict`
   already carries the fresh object; pace its reissue with a flat small jitter (the RCA suggests
   uniform(0, 250 ms)) instead of the growing `reissues`-driven schedule, keeping the capped exponential
   backoff for real transport faults. Size the flat ceiling against the GCS object budget the spec cites;
   with half 1 in place, conflicts come only from other servers and are rare. Pin with an N-writer fake-clock
   test asserting the earliest writer's consecutive-loss streak stays bounded while new arrivals keep
   winning (red today). Update the spec sentences at "Conflicts spend the same budget as errors".

Superseded by the design `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-04-cas-hot-key-write-lane-design.md`
(revision 34, phase A, 2026-09-04; accepted by the codex review of revision 33 with no CRITICAL or MAJOR). Phase A is the fix sketch above minus nothing it needs: a per-pool
FIFO lane above the request engine for any hot compare-and-swap object, the catalog first; one hold at a
time per key from any of the pool's planes; an LRU of last known objects so the next write needs no read,
under one absolute rule (a verdict a `decide` renders on a cached base is never delivered; every write is
conditional on the cached etag); the engine's `WriteResult` returned unchanged; the flat conflict pause,
with the growing schedule kept for a conflict that settled a transport fault (`Conflict::any_ambiguous`);
the step-1 fence marker caught. Revisions 1 to 26 (sixteen codex and six opus rounds) also designed
combining, GCS spacing, a hold clamp and the GC erase inside the lane; that is phase B,
`{#hot-key-lane-phase-b}`, deferred by owner decision on 2026-09-04 after the review loop failed to
converge on its periphery (findings per round never below eight, the document tripled).



### `[hot-key-lane-phase-a-followups]` Phase A of the hot-key lane landed on `cas-hot-key-lane`; what its reviews deferred (2026-09-04) {#hot-key-lane-phase-a-followups}

Branch `cas-hot-key-lane` (12 commits over `e59fe7e8e4b`), `CAS*` gate 2406/2406, reviewed per task (opus/lite),
whole-branch (opus: mergeable) and end to end (codex `gpt-5.6-sol` high: three majors, folded). Not yet merged.

Before or right after merge:
- The new death-test twin `CASRefCatalogDeathTest.AStaleHintCasAdmitEntryAdmitsWhenTheStoreHasRoomAborts` has never
  executed: `lane-g` has no debug or sanitizer build. Run `CASRefCatalog*:CASHotKeys.*` in an ASan build once.
- The acceptance measurement of the design's Task 7 (ten minutes of the parallel stateless suite on the CA-s3 lane:
  `DROP TABLE`/`CREATE TABLE` percentiles, `PreconditionFailed` on `ref_catalog`, the `CASHotKey*` and
  `CASRequestConflictPause` deltas) is the gate for `{#hot-key-lane-phase-b}`.

Deferred by the reviews (all triaged as not blocking the merge; the first is the one the measurement needs):
- The catalog loop's own conflict pauses (`op.pause` in `casUpdateImpl`) have no `ProfileEvents` counter; the engine's
  `CASRequestConflictPause` counts only `readModifyWrite`'s. Add one so the hottest key's pacing is visible.
- Same-thread reentrant `submit` while holding self-waits until the deadline (the spec's callback rule is stated, not
  enforced); a thread-local in-hold flag throwing `LOGICAL_ERROR` would make it immediate. Note: a `LOGICAL_ERROR`
  aborts debug and sanitizer builds.
- `CasRequests.h` pulls `Common/CacheBase.h` into every includer; a forward declaration of `CasHotKeys` plus an
  out-of-line `CasRequests` destructor would confine it.
- `CASRequestConflictPause`'s description says "no transport fault preceded it"; accurate: "in the same inner write".
- `kWaitSlice` in `Backend/` vs the directory's `SCREAMING_SNAKE` constants.
- The `Leave` guard's comment says "allocates nothing"; true only under the lock (the log line after it allocates).
- Tests that discriminate weakly (each carries a deterministic sibling, so none is a false-pass risk today):
  `CleanConflictsBeforeAFault...` (probabilistic; assert the ConflictPause/Reissue deltas),
  `AConflictThatSettledAFault...` (sleep bound non-discriminating; the Reissue delta carries it),
  `ABaseReadThatFails...` (pins only `sent_any` absolutely), `ACachedStartPastTheDeadlineSendsNothing`
  (`decided == 1` is the discriminator, closed by the final review), the corruption test's "break again" arm,
  `AFailedEnqueue...` (only the `inserted == true` arm), the GC-erase test ("exactly" in prose, "at most" in code),
  the "nothing of ours landed" assertion (give the external a distinct `removal_started_round`).
- Unused `ProfileEvents` externs in `gtest_cas_ref_catalog.cpp` and `gtest_cas_pool.cpp` (plan-mandated).
- The two remaining items of `task-1-review.md` (the SDD workspace under `.superpowers/sdd/`, git-ignored; the
  review files there are the only record of them if the workspace is deleted).

### `[hot-key-lane-phase-b]` Hot-key lane phase B: combining, GCS spacing, the hold clamp, the GC erase, `_ckpt` (2026-09-04) {#hot-key-lane-phase-b}

Designed to revision 26 of the hot-key lane spec (commit `26bde9f9604`, 13.5k words) and deferred from
the phase A landing (revision 27) by owner decision on 2026-09-04. Not started. Phase A fixed the seams
so that none of this reopens the callers: `submit`'s signature, `Decide = DecideOnObject`, the engine's
`WriteResult` returned unchanged, the caller's `Conflict` loop and pause rule, the queue of `Item`s with
the guard as the single remover, the hold as base, decide, write, settle. Each sub-item below has its
own gate; none is started on the documentation's say-so.

**0. Caller-side freeze in `dropNamespaceImpl` (do first, not phase B proper).** `cancelStalledCreating`'s
creator-fence read (`isCreatorFenceTerminal(cancel_op, ...)`, `CasRefLedger.cpp:5121`) runs under a
default `Retry::standard()` of its own while `resolveNamespaceLife` freezes once and passes its policy
down (`:1384`). Inside a hold that read can keep the key for up to its own 90 s after its caller's
window. Freeze once at `dropNamespaceImpl`'s entry and pass it to `cancelStalledCreating` and its read.
One-line class; makes the clamp (item 3) unnecessary for phase A.

**1. Combining.** Gate: the phase A acceptance run's `CASHotKeyQueueWaitMicroseconds` per submission
and `PUT` rate on `ref_catalog`; combining pays when the queue wait, not the write, dominates a
submission at p90. The design, with the rules twenty-two rounds established (each was lost once in a
rewrite and found again as a critical, so they are listed): the holder takes the items queued behind it
that were submitted on the same `CasRequests` (the leader's per-attempt fence gate then covers every
member: same atomics, and a re-arm between two admissions is caught by whichever generation is older),
are not under `single_attempt` (leader or member; `Retry::once` permits one attempt and a batch may
reissue), carry no `Liveness` closure (the engine consults one before every physical attempt and the
batch's write is gated on the leader alone; such an item holds alone), and whose bound deadline is not
earlier than the leader's; allocation (`BatchOutcome`, the members vector) before taking, `taken` set in
the same critical section, so a failed allocation takes nothing; "a leader takes this item" and "this
item's caller leaves" decided under one mutex against `taken`, exclusive (the use-after-free the flag
prevents was found by opus round 17). Chain: each member's `decide` on `Object{bytes = candidate, etag =
base etag}` (the etag is a placeholder no `decide` may read as an identity of the bytes), after the
member's own `gate(reservedFor(0, 2))` (`FenceLost`/`NoBudget` written as its `GaveUp` with `sent_any =
false`, `decide` skipped); a member's exception is held; a decline stops the chain so the landed object is
exactly its input; a taken item the chain did not reach is `Conflict{NotObserved}`. Settle: `Committed`
gives each contributor a three-way `gate(0)` as `postCommit` does (`FenceLost` → `GaveUp{FenceLost,
sent_any = true}`; `NoBudget` → `GaveUp{Deadline, Lease, sent_any = true}`; else `Committed{combined
etag, attempts_sent = 0}`), delivers held exceptions, and gives the declined member
`Declined{landed object}`; `Conflict` → every member `Conflict{seen, 0, any_ambiguous}`; `Refused` → the
same `Refused` to every member; `GaveUp` with `sent_any = false` → members `Conflict{NotObserved}`;
`GaveUp` with `sent_any = true` or an exception → members `GaveUp{Unresolved, sent_any = true}` with
their own `Source`. Held verdicts are delivered only from a landed batch (as-if-serial: a batch that does
not land is where serial execution would have landed a prefix). The leader's guard settles unsettled
taken members the same way, settle and erase in one critical section. The as-if-serial argument covers
the lane's key alone; a `decide`'s other reads must not observe a key a batch member may write. A
member's `decide` runs on the leader's thread while its caller is parked (disjoint parts of the member's
operation; the caller's step 1 touches `admitted_generation`, the fence and clock closures, the bound).
`written` is a prefix state the store never held once later members followed (only test callers read
it). Members carry `attempts_sent = 0`; the pool's attempt counters are the leader's. A member's reads
inside the hold need the clamp (item 3). Invariants HK4, HK7, HK8 and tests 1 to 4, 12 and 16 of
revision 26.

**2. `Generation` spacing.** Gate: 429/`SlowDown` count on the catalog key over the parallel stateless
suite on the `gcs` lane after phase A; the owner's position is "GCS will say if we are too fast". The
design: `write_spacing_ms` as a constructor argument (`Pool` passes 1000 on the `Generation` dialect, 0
elsewhere); `Lane::last_write_end_ms` optional, set by a no-throw guard around the engine's write on
return and unwind (the lane exists then, the leader's item is in its queue, nothing allocates); before
the write, `op.pause` the smaller of the remainder and the leader's remaining window, and let the verb's
own entry gate decide (a pause that consumed the window ends `GaveUp{Deadline, sent_any = false}`);
erasure becomes "erase a lane whose queue is empty and whose last write is older than the interval",
swept at enter and leave, with the residue after the pool's last activity bounded by the write rate.
INV-HK9 and tests 17, 18 of revision 26. Ten rounds of findings went into where this lives; above the
engine it is one place, inside `readModifyWrite` it was three call sites and two result families.

**3. The hold clamp.** One optional clamp deadline on `CasOperation`, honoured as a minimum at its
twelve `policy.bind` sites, set by the lane for the hold and by a leader for a member's `decide`,
cleared after; a read the clamp refuses gives up as at its own policy deadline, reported with
`GaveUp::Source::Policy`. Required by combining (a member's nested read runs under the leader's hold);
for phase A, item 0 is the caller-side answer.

**4. The GC erase into the lane.** `deleteCompletedRemovingAtSnapshot`'s body from "refresh authority"
through the `replace` becomes one `submit` whose `decide` refreshes authority, checks `op.admitted()`,
`throwIfAmbiguous` and the exact row, and returns the erased candidate; the mandatory resolution read
after `Committed` stays authoritative for the reconciler's next selection. Four prerequisites: the
refresh reads `gc/state` through the erase's own operation, not a private one, so the clamp reaches it;
the `decide` keeps `throwIfAmbiguous` and the absent-catalog refusal; `CompletedRemovingDeleteResult`
needs the catalog cut the call ends on for `FencedOut` and `EntryChanged`, which a `decide` exception
carries nowhere, so the erase captures the base it was shown or re-reads; the double refresh a
cached-base re-run causes is one extra `gc/state` `GET` inside the hold. Its operation carries a
`Liveness` closure (the cached `authority_held`), so it holds alone and never combines. The authority
gap across the engine's internal reissue (a TTL on the GC lease) stays its own item. Until then the
erase races the lane as it races everything today and costs the lane one stale cache entry per erase.

**5. `_ckpt` and `gc/state` through the lane.** One-call change per site (`readModifyWrite` to `submit`
in a `Conflict` loop with the pause rule). Gate: the audit of the `decide` contract's condition 1 for
`publishCkptContribution`, whose `decide` counts its runs and records its decline's reason in captured
locals that the caller's outcome reads, so a re-run on a fresh base doubles what it reports; move both
out of the closure first. Operations that carry a `Liveness` closure will not combine (item 1) but do
serialize and use the cache. Half 2's go/no-go for `_ckpt` left on `readModifyWrite`: 40·M requests per
second per contended key for M writers, and 429/`SlowDown` not above today's.

**How the design got here, for whoever picks this up.** Twenty-six revisions in one day; findings per
review round never fell below eight; the document tripled while the core (FIFO ticket, `taken`
handshake, cache as a hint the `PUT` validates, engine result unchanged) was judged sound from revision
18 on. About 60% of the MAJOR+ findings after revision 21 were specific to combining, 20% to spacing and
erasure. Rules for the next round of this work: a review revision only removes or tightens, never adds a
feature; a new feature goes in its own revision and costs at least one round; a reviewer verifies
against the checklist above and names the failing scenario; prose and pseudocode slips are MINOR; after
three rounds the remaining questions are answered by code and tests, not by another revision.

### `[cas-s3-lane-put-timeout-logged-at-error]` A stalled single-attempt PUT is logged at Error and fails a stateless test whose write succeeded (2026-09-04) {#cas-s3-lane-put-timeout-logged-at-error}

Seen on the local CA-s3 stateless lane (run 2 after the 404-scope fix): `<Error> WriteBufferFromS3:
S3Exception … Timeout … key cas_s3/cas/ref_catalog` reaches the client's stderr and fails the test
although stdout is right. Root cause (`docs/superpowers/cas/2026-09-04-put-timeout-error-log-rca.md`):
the request engine issues writes through the single-attempt client with `attempt_timeout_ms` = 5000
(`CasRequestBudget` default) and `WriteBufferFromS3` bounded to one attempt, so a stall past 5 s throws
once and `WriteBufferFromS3.cpp` logs it at Error once; the engine then classifies the timeout as
ambiguous, resolves by a read and reissues to the deadline — the write lands, the log line stays. This
predates the request-contract migration (same client, timeout and log site before it); it surfaces
locally under the full parallel suite hammering one S3 endpoint.

Recommended fix (not applied — it touches the upstream slice `src/IO/WriteBufferFromS3.cpp`, consult
first): a thread-local log-severity scope modelled on `Expect404ResponseScope`, opened by the request
engine's write loop around its single-attempt writes, that downgrades only the timeout/network-stall
class at that one `LOG_ERROR` site to Info while still counting `WriteBufferFromS3RequestsErrors`; an
ordinary non-CAS timeout keeps logging at Error. The engine's ambiguity handling is untouched by design.
Until then the class is attributable on the lane by its exact line and key.

### From the engine fix-round review (2026-09-04) {#engine-fix-round-review-2026-09-04}

- **Spec drift.** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-02-cas-backend-token-contract-design.md` (revision 13)
  still prescribes `op.publish(…, Retry::once())` and "never the shared `standard`" for
  `ensureBlobPresent`; since the loop-deadline fix the publish runs under the loop's frozen policy made
  single-attempt (one physical attempt, bounded by the loop's one deadline). Reword the spec sentence. Owner: the spec's next revision (revision 14), one editing pass for all three recorded drifts (this one, `{#spec-drift-ref-lane-once}`, and the `isAccessTokenExpiredError` sentence under `{#codex-prod-review-2026-09-03-residue}`).
- **`CasRefLedger::resolveNamespaceLife` is a third hand-written loop of the forbidden shape:** 32
  iterations, a fresh `Retry::standard()` window per verb, no pacing — the shape the spec's inventory
  rule forbids ("a hand-written loop captures one `Retry` before it starts, shares it across every call
  it makes"). Pre-existing, outside the fix round's brief. Placement: the same freeze-at-entry treatment
  as `deleteCompletedRemovingAtSnapshot` / `ensureBlobPresent` (commit 1effe101617), with a red-first
  test that a perpetual conflict ends within one window; owner = the final fix round of the request-contract plan (2026-09-04), which freezes one policy at entry and paces the re-read arms.

### Spec drift: the ref-lane inventory row says `standard`, the coverage-gate paragraph and the code say `once` (2026-09-04) {#spec-drift-ref-lane-once}

`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-02-cas-backend-token-contract-design.md` (revision 13) lists "the ref lane
(`commitRefChunk`, the recovery walk, `resolveWedgeOnce`) — `create` under `standard`" in the inventory
table, while its coverage-gate paragraph states that "the `once` writes of the pulse and the wedge retry
are never a key's first request" and that the recovery walk's epoch seal at `T+1` is a `once` write.
The implementation follows the paragraph (`resolveWedgeOnce` and the recovery seal `create` under
`Retry::once`; the lane's own next flush is the retry), as chosen in the migration's ref-ledger unit and
approved by its review. Fix: reword the inventory row to say `commitRefChunk` under `standard`, the wedge
retry and the epoch seal under `once` with the reason. Found by the external test review (tests-02 #7/#8).

### Soak 2026-09-04 (phase 3, 30 min, seed 20260904, binary 6ddaefbcc9e) — return items {#soak-2026-09-04-return-items}

Verdict PASS (`SOAK_EXIT=0`, both checkpoints `dangling=0 stale_edge=0 dryrun_count=0`, `GaveUp` = 0 on both
nodes; ch1 self-fenced and remounted cleanly under the one `freeze_long` fault). Three items survive the
analysis (full evidence in the plan workspace's soak report at the time; the run row is appended to
`utils/ca-soak/scenarios/RUN_HISTORY.md`):

- **GC round cost at ~825k objects.** The `gc_checkpoint` stage's GC on ch1 cost 1934.9 s cumulative over
  50 rounds, single rounds up to 179.8 s in `manifest_deletes`; the driver's pool-drain wait blocked on it,
  so the "30-minute" run took 2590 s wall-clock (+44%). Profile `CasPool`'s `manifest_deletes` and
  `fold_ref_intake` phases at that object count before trusting any duration-budgeted phase-3 gate.
- **`B152/B185` warning text is wrong for this occurrence.** `wait_for_pool_consistent` in
  `utils/ca-soak/soak/run.py` reports "did not HOLD dangling==0 … after a fault window", but the flap
  happened in the routine `gc_checkpoint` stage before any chaos fault. Broaden or correct the message so
  a real future finding is not dismissed as the known post-restart flap.
- **Pool drain probe `None` under load.** One `pool_bytes=None` sample at 23:26:26Z inside the GC-drain
  window; plausibly a `docker exec`/`du` subprocess timeout under host I/O contention, unprovable from
  RustFS logs (known observability gap). `soak/pool.py` `pool_size` should log subprocess-timeout and
  empty-stdout as distinct causes.

Also noted, no item: `_ckpt checkpoint could not be advanced … persistent CAS contention` errors in the
steady/mutations stages traced to RustFS `PUT` timeouts on the same objects moments earlier, all
self-healed; the dominant `AWSClient 404` error-log volume is the expected `HEAD`-miss dedup probing.

### Codex production review (2026-09-03, adjudicated) — residue {#codex-prod-review-2026-09-03-residue}

Adjudication of the external reviewer's 10 findings against spec revision 13: 3 confirmed defects (fixed in
the plan's fix round: read classification narrowed to authoritative absence; one absolute bound per
hand-written loop in `deleteCompletedRemovingAtSnapshot` and `ensureBlobPresent`; `claimMount`'s raced
branches return the observed body), 3 design-accepted, 2 rejected, 2 prose. What remains here:

- **Spec drift.** The spec's retry section names `S3Exception::isAccessTokenExpiredError` as the
  refreshability predicate; the landed `isRefreshableCredentialError` is deliberately narrower (named codes
  only, never `S3Errors::UNKNOWN`), because the general predicate would turn every unmodelled store answer
  into a refusal. The spec sentence is stale; the ruling is recorded in
  `docs/superpowers/cas/2026-09-03-request-contract-rulings.md`. Fix: reword the spec sentence to name the
  CAS-local predicate and its reason.
- **Accepted request costs, recorded so nobody re-argues them without new evidence:** one extra `GET` per
  conflicting iteration of the catalog erase loop (the post-write read is also what convicts a false
  `Committed`; `Conflict::seen` may be `NotObserved`); one extra `GET` on the pool-meta union path and on its
  lost-create path (the steady-state open stays one `GET`); one extra `GET` on the lost marker-create path of
  blob publication.

Append new items here — quick adds and concurrent-agent findings land in this section, unformatted
is fine. They get triaged into the topic files above during the next grooming pass. Do not delete
from here without triaging; do not hand-sort into a topic file without checking the item's anchor
isn't referenced elsewhere first.

### Resolved 2026-09-03 — docs pass (Task 25) {#inbox-resolved-2026-09-03-docs}
Closed by the request-contract spec revision 13 and the operator-docs update
(`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-02-cas-backend-token-contract-design.md`, `docs/en/antalya/cas/operations/{debugging,monitoring,troubleshooting}.md`, `docs/en/operations/system-tables/cas_log.md`); the rulings behind each are in
[the rulings doc](2026-09-03-request-contract-rulings.md). Source-comment items with the same substance stay in the sections below — that pass runs after the build.
- Operator note: `system.cas_log`'s `token` column now renders `<dialect>:<value>` uniformly across every event type (verified against the landed code, not only `BlobReuseAdopt`/`ManifestPut`); documented in `cas_log.md`.
- SPEC DRIFT: `CasFsck`'s retirement check only classifies, never removes; `CasOperation::stream` takes no size parameter; `allocateWriterEpoch`'s non-convergence at the deadline is retry-later via the shared `orThrow`, not its own `CORRUPTED_DATA` switch.
- SPEC DRIFT: `GaveUp` (and `Conflict`/`Refused`) now carry `attempts_sent`, `Declined` does not; `CasOperation::pause`/`CasRequests::pause` are in the spec; the `ensureBlobPresent` row states `publish` under `once` with a fresh envelope per attempt and create-first `reconcileMetaClean`; the generation-capture scope (one `txn_generation` at transaction start, every upload task via `resume`) is stated.
- Operator note: the mount renewal audit event's old→new key mapping (`retrying`/`unresolved_reason`/`deadline_source`/`stop_cause` → one `classification` value + `attempts_sent`) is documented, with the full `classification` value list.
- Engine note: `isDefinitelyRefusedWrite`'s `#if USE_AWS_S3` scoping (so `Refused` is unreachable on a non-S3 build) and `Declined` carrying no `attempts_sent` are both stated in the spec.
- SPEC DRIFT (engine fix round): the `Why::Unresolved` `last_seen` enumeration now includes the precondition-unchanged `Object`/`Meta` case; the resolve order for `replace` (unchanged precondition first, byte equality only once it has moved) is corrected; ambiguity is stated as scoped to one inner write of a `readModifyWrite`, with the other `WriteState` fields call-wide.
- CP4′ fixer calibration note: the engine reserves `Backend::attemptTimeoutMs()` per attempt, not `CasRequestBudget::attempt_timeout_ms`; stated in the spec's reservation paragraph (the `~Pool` destructor policy this bullet also carried is an architecture note, not a docs claim, and is recorded as-is in the rulings doc).

### Resolved 2026-09-03 — source-comment pass (Task 25) {#inbox-resolved-2026-09-03-source-comments}
Closed by the code-comment half of Task 25 (`26b9ba8a495`). Each item was verified against the current
code before being touched; comments now state the reason and drop plan/review provenance.
- `src/Disks/DiskObjectStorage/MetadataStorages/ContentAddressed/README.md`'s `Backend/` bullet named the
  deleted `CasRequestControl` and the deleted token-aware verbs; rewritten to name `CasBackend`'s
  transport primitives and `CasRequests`.
- `Backend/CasBackend.h`'s `ProbeOutcome` comment claimed ordinary `head`/`read` flatten container,
  permission and transport faults into absence; `isObjectNotFound` only flattens an authoritative key
  miss, so the comment is corrected to say every other fault propagates as an exception.
- `Backend/CasBackend.h`'s `checkConditionalWriteSingleAttemptSupport` comment said the capability probe
  checks it; `Pool::open` asks it directly through `backendForCapabilityPredicates()` before the probe
  operation is admitted — corrected (also closes U1-review.md's Prose P7).
- `src/Disks/tests/gtest_cas_pool.cpp`'s `WriteCountingBackend`/`ProbeWatchingBackend` instrumentation
  comments: already correct, no longer cite `probeSentinelRaw` — checked, no change.
- `src/Disks/tests/gtest_cas_forget.cpp`'s `ForgetRacingActiveRemountThreadCompletesBounded` mechanism
  comment: already correct — `ToggleableTransportFaultBackend`'s fault already sits on the `head`/`read`/
  `list` primitives now that U1 has landed, so "keeps every attempt at `StayTransient`" holds. Checked,
  no change.
- `Pool/CasRefProtocol.cpp`'s `crossEpochFromSeal` doc comment (the checkpoint-snapshot reader) still
  cited "review NEW-3" / "review C3" after its header twin (`CasRefProtocol.h`) was already cleaned — the
  citations are dropped, the reason kept.
- U1-review.md's Prose: P3 (`CasPool.h`'s `farewellRequests()` doc described only the lease-release half
  of a plane the mount-lease renewer's claim/adopt also shares) and P4
  (`ContentAddressedTransaction.cpp`'s staging write buffer comment claimed a live operation ties two
  generation reads together, when `admit().generation()` is a plain value off a temporary) are fixed; P7
  is the `checkConditionalWriteSingleAttemptSupport` fix above. P6 (`CasRequestBudget.cpp`'s logger tag)
  already reads `"CasRequestBudget"`, checked, no change. P8 names only a workspace report file, not
  applicable here.
- U10-review.md's P1–P6: none names a source comment worth changing — P1/P3/P4/P6 are about the U10 task
  report or an already-correct call site, P2 is already fixed (`CasMountRuntime.cpp` derives the renewal
  counters on every outcome, not only `Committed`), P5 is a ruling-doc item. P7 remains open below.
- U9-rereview.md's NEW-2: `gtest_cas_part_write.cpp`'s `HeadThenDeleteOnceBackend` inline comment still
  claimed the HEAD-to-GET window its class doc had already dropped; fixed. NEW-3 remains open below.
- U6-rereview.md's F2: `CatalogLifecycleReconciler::reconcile`'s header doc is already correct — the
  refresh runs unconditionally before the drain-complete verdict, including when there is no eligible
  row to erase. Checked, no change. F4: the ten internal-document-reference sites in
  `Pool/CasRefCatalog.h`, and the matching sites in `gtest_cas_ref_catalog_birth_wiring.cpp` and
  `gtest_cas_ref_ckpt.cpp`, are cleaned (kept the reason, dropped the `Task N` / review citations).
  `Pool/CasRefCatalog.cpp`'s two sites remain open below.

### From the CP3 (Task 7) review, 2026-09-03 — prose only {#inbox-cp3-review-prose}
- `task-7-report.md` (workspace only): "no caller reaches them yet" — legacy write verbs reach `write`/`remove` through the forwarders; the accurate claim is that no assertion needs a per-key write counter.
- RESOLVED 2026-09-04 (final review): the `PLANES` doc's `Liveness` IS passed — `CasMountRuntime::startRenewer` gives `[this]{ return !renewalCancelled(); }`; the note below was stale.
  - (was) U10 review prose batch (units/U10-review.md P7): the `PLANES` doc in `Pool/CasServerRoot.h` promising a `Liveness` no production caller passes — `CasMountRuntime::installRenewer` (renamed from `installKeeper`) supplies none either. `CasServerRoot.h` is a forbidden file for the source-comment pass; left for the engine-defect pass.
- U9 prose (units/U9-rereview.md NEW-3): `Pool/CasPartWriteTxn.cpp`'s `reconcileMetaClean` create-first gate comment over-states what an absent observation implies (an absent body does not imply an absent marker). Forbidden file for the source-comment pass; left for the engine-defect pass.
- RESOLVED: the callerless `stagingPutIfAbsentMutable`/`stagingConditionalOverwrite` LOCK TASK item above is stale — `grep -rn` over `src/` and `programs/` finds no such symbol anywhere in the tree; the deletion already happened.
- U6 re-review prose (units/U6-rereview.md F4, `Pool/CasRefCatalog.cpp`): its two internal-document-reference sites (the header and test-file sweep did not reach `.cpp`, a forbidden file for the source-comment pass); left for the engine-defect pass.
- Engine test seam (if the checkpoint shows jitter-dependent reds): `Retry::backoff` draws full jitter with no test seam, so a test driving an ambiguity under `untilLeaseSafe` with a short remaining lease is a coin flip; a `setBackoffFnForTest` on `CasRequests` (used by `pauseAndReissue`) would make it deterministic. `MountLeaseRenewer::renewOn`'s (renamed from `MountLeaseKeeper`) `catch (...)` arm reports `attempts_sent = 0` — an exception that escaped the engine carries no count; document at the field. `Pool/CasServerRoot.h` is a forbidden file for the source-comment pass; left for the engine-defect pass.
- Product question from the lock (2026-09-03): `CAS_WRITE_UNATTRIBUTED` is unreachable on the Native/S3 write path now — its only throw site was the deleted legacy minter, and the request engine settles a 2xx whose value fits no grammar by a resolve read (`GaveUp{Unresolved}` at the deadline). Decide whether a distinct unattributed-write signal is wanted (an event/counter) or the error code is retired; the three tests that pinned the throw now pin the give-up. (Spec revision 13 records this as an open product question rather than deciding it — see [the rulings doc](2026-09-03-request-contract-rulings.md).)

### From the engine fix round review, 2026-09-03 — prose and spec drift {#inbox-engine-fix-prose}
- `Backend/CasRequests.h`, doc on `isDefinitelyRefusedWrite`: still says the engine refuses when "there is no reissue left to sign with what it did install" — under `once` no refresh is invoked any more, so that disjunct is unreachable; drop it. (FALSE)
- `Backend/CasRequests.h`, `WriteState::any_ambiguous` comment: "an inner write that ended in `Conflict` saw the precondition move" is false of the `!any_ambiguous` arm, which returns `Conflict{NotObserved}` having proved nothing — scope the claim to the ambiguous arm.
- `Backend/CasRequests.cpp`, `writeLoop` reset comment: "sent DIFFERENT bytes" is not guaranteed (`decide` may repeat bytes); the proof is the observed precondition, not the byte difference.
- `Backend/CasRequests.h`, `admit`/`resume` thread-safety comment: the conclusion is right, the enumeration is not (neither reads the backend; `resume` reads no member).


## `[relink-confirm-model-prose]` Five prose imprecisions left in `CaRelinkConfirmCore` and its results {#relink-confirm-model-prose}

Found 2026-09-02 by the reviews of the ref-scoped rule 3 change (spec
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-02-cas-relink-confirm-liveness-design.md`). All prose, none blocking;
they were held out of the fix loop deliberately and are listed here so a later pass can take them
together.

- `"With only two admitted shapes"` is given as the reason rule 3 can never refuse under
  `SabotageTouchBlind`, in four places including a commit message. It is not the reason: the predicate
  is constant false under the flag whatever the shape count, so a reader would wrongly conclude that
  adding a third shape restores the sabotage.
- The `~NoopDurable` guard on `SenderAdmitNoop` carries no comment. A future reader could delete it as
  redundant with the else-arm guard and silently reinstate the defect it fixes (a second noop tenure
  closing, and poisoning, having written nothing).
- `CaRelinkConfirmCore_sab_stalecache.cfg`'s header still calls rule 3 "lane quiescence -- no pending
  item, no leader tenure, no wedge", which is no longer what the rule reads.
- The module header's "removes exactly ONE load-bearing rule" invites a partition reading now that two
  flags target rule 3.
- `SenderDurable`'s "same guard as `NsNoise`" is analogous, not identical; and the `_sab_nopoison`
  narrative is loose about where graduation completes.


## `[write-token-provenance-not-in-the-api]` A write's token may come from a later, unrelated `HEAD`, and nothing in the type says so {#write-token-provenance}

Found 2026-09-01 while designing self-authored mount reclaim; it is the blocker that killed revision 4
of `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-01-cas-self-authored-mount-reclaim-design.md`.

`ObjectStorageBackend::tokenFromWriteResult` decides how much to trust the token of a successful
conditional write, and the two dialects disagree about what to do when the response carries none:

- **Generation (GCS)** throws `CORRUPTED_DATA`, on the stated grounds that "there is no follow-up HEAD,
  so a broken or lying response can never be silently patched over by a later, **unrelated** read"
  (`CasObjectStorageBackend.h:187-193`);
- **ETag, and any backend with no write-time token at all** issues exactly that later, unrelated read —
  a fresh `HEAD` whose result is returned as if it were the write's token
  (`CasObjectStorageBackend.cpp:860-865`).

This is a deliberate scope boundary, not an oversight: `tokenFromWriteResult` was introduced by
`9b887ac8886` "Bind GCS CAS writes to exact response generations" (2026-08-21), whose own message says
"every other dialect keeps the pre-existing HEAD-fallback behavior unchanged". The GCS work saw the
attribution problem and fixed it only where it was working.

**The hazard.** Our write commits, the response carries no ETag, our fallback `HEAD` stalls, another
writer claims and arms authority, and our `HEAD` returns *their* token — which we then hold as the
token of our own write.

**There is already a consumer where this is not fail-safe.** `Gc::acquireOrRenewLease` takes its
`state_token` straight from the write result (`CasGc.cpp:4397`, `:4418` — both `casPut` results), and the round commit CASes
`gc/state` against it (`CasGc.cpp:944`). So a GC leader whose acquire response carried no ETag, and
whose fallback `HEAD` returned a *successor* leader's token, holds a token that matches the successor's
state — and its round commit succeeds over a leader that believes it holds the lease. The failing CAS
that is supposed to stop a displaced leader does not fail.

`MountLeaseKeeper::last_token` is the milder case: there the value is only an `If-Match` precondition,
so a wrong token costs a failed renewal and a fence rather than a wrong action — though even there the
containment is a property of the mount controller's own gates, not of the token. Nothing at the type
level distinguishes the two situations, and a consumer that treats the token as *identifying* our body
rather than merely *conditioning* the next write turns it into an overwrite of a live holder. Revision 4
of the reclaim design was exactly that consumer, which is how this was found.

(An earlier version of this entry claimed every current consumer was fail-safe. The GC lease path
refutes that; corrected 2026-09-02.)

**Fix direction: put provenance in `PutResult`, do not make the ETag path throw.** A `nullopt` is
structural for backends with no write-time token (local files, a non-S3 `IObjectStorage`), so throwing
would break them. Aligning the API means making "attributed to this write" versus "observed afterwards"
a fact the caller can see, after which each dialect maps onto it honestly and each consumer decides:
GCS keeps throwing (a missing generation there is a genuine anomaly), ETag and the token-less backends
return committed-with-unattributed-token.

Then revisit `MountLeaseKeeper::last_token`: an unattributed token is a guess, and the keeper might
better treat its own write as unresolved and re-resolve than store one.

Related: `[empty-token-unconditional-write-guard]` covers the *empty* token this same fallback can
produce; this item is about a *wrong* one. Both come from the same three lines.

## `[resolved-by-get-unbounds-clone-overlap]` Exact-byte resolution lets lockstep clones both stay authoritative indefinitely {#resolved-by-get-clone-overlap}

Found 2026-09-01, same design work. Not a fix this release needs; recorded because two successive
revisions of that design asserted the opposite baseline and were wrong.

A VM snapshot restored twice gives two runtimes with the same `server_uuid`, the same
`MountLeaseKeeper` state and the same `thread_local_rng` state, so they mint the same
`write_attempt_id` (`UUID.cpp:11`). Where their other body inputs also stay in lockstep — wall time,
hostname, PID, `seq`, watermark — they build **byte-identical** renewal bodies. One lands; the other
loses its `If-Match`, and `putOverwriteControlled`'s resolve-by-get sees identical bytes at a changed
token and reports `Committed` to it too (`CasRequestControl.cpp:678-687`). Both extend local authority,
and the cycle can repeat.

So the intuition that the token guard fences whichever clone loses, bounding the overlap to about one
renew period, is false: `resolved_by_get` is what removes the bound. Cloning a running server that holds
a CAS mount is outside supported operation, so this is a documentation and threat-model item rather than
a fix — but the mount documentation should say it, and any future argument that reasons from "the store
serialises us" should not assume a bound that is not there.




The eleven items below are untouched since the 2026-08-04 consolidation-audit findings that produced
them; the nine below those are the "found during the 2026-08 documentation consolidation" batch from
the same day. Both sets are moved here verbatim as part of the 2026-08-04 folder restructure — content
unchanged, only relocated.

### From the 2026-08-04 destructive-baseline / soak audit {#inbox-audit-batch}

## `[s27-list-anomaly-aimed-at-a-retired-path]` S27 perturbs a prefix nothing lists any more {#s27-list-anomaly-aimed-at-a-retired-path}

**Found by the full scenario sweep (2026-08-31). S27 FAILED, and it failed for the right reason.**

The card injects LIST anomalies — pagination ambiguity, duplicate and missing pages — on
`cas/refs/` and checks that discovery survives them. Its verdict was:

> LIST anomalies were injected on cas/refs/ (test not vacuous): expected > 0 perturbed LISTs,
> observed 0 — proxy perturbed 0 LISTs — discovery may not have re-listed cas/refs/

Discovery does not list that prefix any more, and has not since discovery authority moved to the
pool-wide `cas/ref_catalog` object. The registry records the change in as many words: "Value 10 is
retired: discovery authority is the pool-wide `cas/ref_catalog` object rather than a roots registry
object or a physical stream listing." A grep of the CAS tree finds no listing of `cas/refs/` at all.

**The card did the right thing.** It carries a not-vacuous guard, and that guard is what fired: rather
than reporting a serene PASS for an injection that reached nothing, it failed and said the injection
reached nothing. A scenario without that guard would have been quietly reporting success against a
retired code path for as long as the path has been retired.

**The subject is not gone, only moved.** LIST is still load-bearing, for GC rather than discovery:
`CasNamespaceJanitor` pages `namespaceRootPrefix()`, `CasOrphanManifestSweep` pages
`casManifestsPrefix()`, and `CasGc` pages its own prefix. Pagination ambiguity on any of those is
exactly the hazard S27 was written for, and none of them is covered today.

**Fix direction:** re-aim the injection at the prefixes GC actually pages, and assert on GC's
outcome — no object deleted that a complete listing would have shown as reachable — rather than on
discovery's. Retiring the card instead would drop a real hazard class on the floor.

## `[ca-write-buffer-allocation-concentration]` Two write-buffer constructors account for essentially all CAS allocation activity {#ca-write-buffer-allocation-concentration}

**Found by profiling a one-hour chaos soak (2026-08-31) against `system.trace_log`.**

**Read the counts as a ratio, not as a census.** The same export that produced them was
CAS-filtered (`WHERE stack LIKE '%DB::Cas::%'`), so no non-CAS allocator appears here and this is
not a ranking of server-wide allocation; and it summed 38 snapshots of a cumulative table, so every
absolute number is inflated by roughly the number of snapshots a sample survived into. Neither
defect touches the finding, because both act as a near-uniform multiplier across the frames being
compared, and the finding is the **200-fold gap between second and third place** — a ratio that no
plausible per-frame variation in either defect can manufacture. The Memory profile also rests on
25k-154k samples rather than the CPU profile's few hundred. Do not quote the absolute sample counts
anywhere; quote the ratio.

Aggregating CAS frames by sample count, the Memory profile is not merely dominated by two frames —
everything else is invisible next to them:

| frame | Memory samples |
|---|---:|
| `CaContentWriteBuffer::CaContentWriteBuffer` | 85,991 |
| `CaInlineWriteBuffer::CaInlineWriteBuffer` | 35,600 |
| next entry (`PartWriteTxn::promote`) | 175 |

A factor of 200 between second and third place. Reading the constructor explains it: each content
write allocates its streaming buffer via `clampCasWriteBufferSize`, and then a **second per-stream
spill buffer**, and creates a temp directory and a random temp path. Every blob write pays this.

**What this does NOT establish.** These are allocation samples, not time. The Real profile's top is
the upload wait — `ensureBlobPresent` and `fanOutBlobUploads` at ~116,000 samples each against 3,750
CPU samples, a ratio near 31:1 — so the write path is overwhelmingly I/O-bound and buffer allocation
is not visibly on the critical path. A pooling change could remove a great deal of allocation churn
and move the wall clock by nothing at all.

That caution is not hypothetical: on this same campaign two changes that plainly removed waste
measured exactly zero, and one that plainly removed a copy measured a reproducible *regression*. The
one that paid was the one whose mechanism predicted which formats would improve.

**Measure before changing anything:** what fraction of a blob write's wall time is buffer
construction, from a scoped profile of the write path rather than from the sample counts above. If it
is under a percent, this entry should be closed as "concentrated but not costly" rather than acted
on.

**Retracted: there is no usable CPU profile from this soak, so nothing here ranks by CPU.**
An earlier revision of this entry ranked `ObjectStorageBackend::nativeHead` in "the CPU top" and
then explained the mechanism. Three defects, each fatal on its own, mean no CPU ranking from this
run may be cited:

1. **Filtered by construction.** The export ran `WHERE stack LIKE '%DB::Cas::%'`, so every frame not
   named `DB::Cas::*` — hashing, compression, serialization, the whole of the generic engine — was
   excluded before aggregation. Asking why checksums are absent from that file is asking why a file
   does not contain what it was built to exclude.
2. **No samples to speak of.** Over the hour the `CPU` trace type accrued **369 samples**, against
   963,049 for `Real`. The CPU profiler fires on thread CPU time, and these threads spent almost
   none: the workload is S3-bound. A few hundred samples cannot support a ranking.
3. **Multiply counted.** The dump queried the cumulative `system.trace_log` every ten minutes and
   the frame aggregate summed 38 such snapshots, so the same sample is counted once per snapshot it
   survived into. The arithmetic shows it plainly: the retained stacks hold 1,460 samples while the
   top frame claims 4,713.

The `Real` profile does not share defects 2 and 3's severity — 963k samples — but is subject to
defect 1, and remains the basis for the only claim worth keeping from this run: the write path waits
far more than it computes.

**What a real answer needs:** a CPU-bound workload (bulk insert of large parts, where content
hashing actually has bytes to chew) profiled with an unfiltered query and a single end-of-run
snapshot. Until that exists, this entry asserts nothing about where CAS spends CPU.

## `[ref-catalog-write-hotspot]` The pool-wide ref catalog is the only object that timed out under a full-suite workload {#ref-catalog-write-hotspot}

**Found by the first full local run of the stateless suite on CAS storage (2026-08-30), 11,137 tests.**

One test failed with `Code: 499 ... Timeout ... key cas_s3/cas/ref_catalog, object size 41454`. The
S3 client retried twice more and both retries timed out at the same size, so this is one logical
write, not three failures.

What makes it worth recording is the negative half: across 11,137 tests, **`ref_catalog` was the
only object class whose write ever timed out.** No blob, no manifest, no ref log. The catalog is
pool-wide, mutable, and rewritten whenever a namespace is created or dropped — and a full stateless
suite creates and drops tables continuously, so the catalog is both the hottest write in the pool and
the one that grows with the number of namespaces that have ever existed in it.

This is **not** established as a defect. The run had a load average above 20 with a saturated
single-node object store, and a 41 KB write timing out under that is plausible on its own. What is
established is where the pressure lands.

**Worth measuring before deciding anything:** how catalog size and rewrite frequency scale with
namespace churn, and whether the write is proportional to the whole catalog or to the change. If it
is the whole catalog on every change, the cost is quadratic in namespace count over a workload's
lifetime, and a busy pool reaches the timeout on merit rather than by luck.

This finding is the argument for the full lane existing at all: the 41-test CAS selector that stood
in for it could never have produced this, because it never creates enough namespaces to grow the
catalog.

**Reads time out too, and the rate grows with the run (measured 2026-09-04, parallel stateless lane
on RustFS, binary 9bf134686af). Root cause found: the S3 client's adaptive first-attempt timeout.**
`AWSClient` logged `Failed to make request to ...cas_s3/cas/ref_catalog: will be retried,
Poco::TimeoutException` for GETs of this one key: 1 222 of 1 233 such lines in a 30-minute window were
this key; 24, 260, 305, 401, 436, 468, 455 per 10-minute window over the run. The logged stack throws
in `SocketImpl::receiveBytes` under `HTTPClientSession::receiveResponse`, i.e. waiting for the response
headers. With `s3_use_adaptive_timeouts` (default on) the first attempt of every request runs under
`TimeoutsForFirstAttempt`: 200 ms to the first byte for GET (`src/IO/ConnectionTimeouts.cpp`),
saturated against the request timeout, so the CAS `attempt_timeout_ms` of 5 000 never applies to the
first try. The catalog is rewritten through conditional PUTs 467 times a minute (hot-key lane submits,
`CASHotKeyCacheStarts` delta), it had grown to 104 KB / 612 entries, and a PUT on RustFS costs 54 ms
or more; a GET that lands while the object is being rewritten waits behind it and trips the 200 ms
fuse. The retry is the CAS engine's own (`Retry::standard`, jittered backoff 0-200 ms first), and it
succeeds. Cost: every hit shows as exactly 3 `S3ReadRequestsErrors`; `CREATE TABLE` with one hit
p50 233 ms against 0 ms without (2 731 of 8 943 statements in 30 minutes, 32%), with two hits
p50 962 ms (57 statements). Not caused by write contention: `PreconditionFailed` on the catalog and
`CASHotKeyQueueWaitMicroseconds` are flat over the run while the timeout rate grows fivefold; what
grows is the object and therefore the window a GET spends behind a PUT.

Fix direction (user ruling 2026-09-04: keep the adaptive fuse, it exists to abandon a bad connection
to real S3 quickly; make the CAS retry cooperate with it instead of fighting it). Today the engine's
reissue is a brand-new request: `ReadBufferFromS3` starts at attempt 1 (`max_single_read_retries` is 1
for CAS reads), `PocoHTTPClient` sees `first_attempt` again and applies the 200 ms fuse again, and the
engine sleeps `Retry::backoff(attempt)` (0-200 ms jitter) before it. Upstream's own retry does the
opposite: attempt 2 runs on a fresh connection with the full timeouts (`Client.cpp:847` bumps
`setClickhouseAttemptNumber`). Two changes, both in the CAS engine plus one small seam:
(1) thread the engine's attempt number into the request — `readSettingsFor(profile, timeout, attempt)`
and the write twin carry it in `ReadSettings`/`WriteSettings`, `ReadBufferFromS3::sendRequest` /
the write path seed `setClickhouseAttemptNumber` from it (upstream seam, consult first) — so the
reissue gets the full `attempt_timeout_ms` on a new connection; (2) classify a first-attempt
`Poco::TimeoutException` as a connection-quality retry: reissue at once, no backoff, still under the
deadline gate; backoff stays for attempt ≥ 2 and for every store-side fault. Expected on the lane:
a hit costs the 200 ms fuse only, the double-hit case (p50 962 ms) disappears. The catalog growth
itself stays the hotspot above.

## `[cas-decode-register-pressure]` WITHDRAWN — the finding was a build-flag artifact {#cas-decode-register-pressure}

**Raised 2026-08-30 on an assembly review, withdrawn the same day.**

The item claimed that the wire-key cut raised register pressure in `SourceEdgeRunReader::next`, on
the evidence that spill density rose from 22.1% to 25.8% with new spills inside the hot loop. That
comparison was taken across two binaries built with different frame-pointer settings: the after side
reserved `rbp`, the before side did not. On correctly matched binaries spill density **falls** in
every decode symbol inspected and does not move in the encode symbol. There is nothing here to fix.

Kept as a withdrawn entry rather than deleted, because the reasoning that produced it was published
and someone may come looking for it.

## `[cas-decode-per-row-scratch]` The `cas_run` reader rebuilds its scratch every row; the writer does not {#cas-decode-per-row-scratch}

**Found while reading the decode path during the wire-keys phase-3 review (2026-08-30).**

Every decoded `cas_run` row allocates a `String` for the line through `readLine`, constructs a
`JsonObjectReader` — which owns a `std::vector<String> seen_keys` that grows as keys are read — and
destroys both. The write side already solved this: `SourceEdgeRunWriter` holds a reused
`CasJsonWriter scratch`, documented as keeping memory bounded by the largest line ever assembled
rather than by record count. The read side never received the same treatment.

Two related pieces of waste sit in the same place. `JsonObjectReader::nextKey` rejects duplicate keys
with `std::find` over that vector, comparing whole strings, which is quadratic in the keys on a row;
since every format's key set is fixed and already enumerated by the shared collectors, the check
could be a bit per known key, with no allocation and no string comparison. And `readString` returns
by value, so each wide field is a fresh allocation.

**This is not a regression from the wire-key cut** — it costs the same on both sides and appears in
no delta. It was in fact the leading pre-measurement hypothesis for where the cut's cost would land,
and the measurement refuted it: the hypothesis predicts that the format with the most keys per row
suffers most, and that format (`cas_fold_seal`) decodes 7 points cheaper than its byte growth, the
best of the five. Worth doing as a straightforward win, not as a fix for anything the cut caused.

## `[s45-drop-member-sweep-untested]` GC wins S45's race, so `cas-drop-member`'s own sweep path is never exercised {#s45-drop-member-sweep-untested}

**Found while triaging an S45 soak failure during the wire-keys proof phase (2026-08-30).**

S45 exists to prove that decommissioning a member does not leave its `Removing` catalog rows behind
as permanent debris, and it asserted that `cas-drop-member` reported `namespaces_removed >= 3`. It
reported zero, deterministically, including on the seed that passed on 2026-08-03.

The card cannot win the race it depends on. `cas-drop-member` refuses to run while the victim's mount
lease is alive, so the card must wait for the lease to lapse — and the SURVIVOR is the pool's GC
leader, which retires `Removing` namespaces pool-wide during exactly that wait. Instrumenting the
catalog on both sides of the wait showed it plainly: three victim and three survivor `removing` rows
right after the kill, and none of the six by the time the tool returned. The survivor's own rows went
too, and the tool never touches those, so GC — not the tool — did the sweeping. The tool then
correctly reported nothing to remove, with `slot_removed=true`.

The verdict has been rewritten to assert the invariant the scenario actually protects (no victim rows
survive the decommission) plus a precondition check that the hidden rows existed at the kill. **What
that loses is the only coverage of the tool's own sweep path.** When GC wins, that path never runs, so
a regression in `cas-drop-member`'s namespace sweeping would not be caught by any scenario.

**Fix direction:** give S45 a compose variant with `cas_gc_enabled` off on the survivor, so the
`Removing` rows persist through the lease-lapse wait and the tool is the only thing that can sweep
them. That makes the premise holdable by construction instead of by luck, and restores the assertion
that `namespaces_removed` matches the table count.

## `[blob-reuse-resurrect-no-emitter]` `BlobReuseResurrect` has no emitter, and the condemned-token re-upload has no positive test {#blob-reuse-resurrect-no-emitter}

**Found while triaging an S16 soak failure during the wire-keys proof phase (2026-08-30).**

`CasEventType::BlobReuseResurrect` is still declared in `Primitives/CasEvent.h` and still maps to the
string `blob_reuse_resurrect` in `CasEvent.cpp`, but nothing in `src/` raises it — only
`BlobReuseAdopt` is emitted, from two sites in `Pool/CasPartWriteTxn.cpp`. `git log -S` puts the
removal at `907c3b5ce7d` ("Publish CAS blobs after mandatory `HEAD`"): once publication became
unconditional after a mandatory `HEAD`, a writer no longer splits reuse into adopt versus resurrect,
because it always re-uploads from source.

Two separate things are left over.

**A dead enum member.** It costs nothing at runtime, but it makes the event vocabulary lie: a reader of
`system.cas_log`'s event set will look for a value that can never appear, which is exactly the trap
S16 fell into — its verdict required the event and so could not pass at any scale.

**A real coverage gap, which is the part that matters.** S16 was the only positive check that a
CONDEMNED token specifically forces a re-upload rather than a revival. Its assertion has been replaced
with one that requires reuse to happen at all, so the resurrect invariant is now guarded only by S16's
proxy — correct data on every cycle plus no bad CA events. That proxy is genuine but negative: it
would catch a revival that corrupted data or raised a bad event, and would miss one that happened to
return the right bytes. Restoring a direct check means finding an observable that distinguishes
"re-uploaded from writer-owned source" from "revived from the condemned object" under the current
architecture — a counter, an event, or a fault-injected condemned object that must not be readable.

## `[gc-mf-cleanup-durable-retry]` Manifest-cleanup GC phase needs durable retry, not a cap {#gc-mf-cleanup-durable-retry}

**Found by a 24h soak (`soak-t6b-report.md`) after `gc_round_manifest_cleanup_budget` landed as one of
T6b's per-round work-envelope caps; the setting was removed entirely rather than tuned.**

The post-CAS `manifest_deletes` phase (`Gc::runRegularRound`, `Gc/CasGc.cpp`) is a **one-shot pipeline**:
the ref-log intake cursor that discovers each owner-removed manifest's `-1` edge commits in the SAME
round's CAS that produces the `mf_cleanup` set, before the deletes run. A cap on this phase does not defer
the excess to a later round of the same pipeline — a cap-declined entry is never re-derived, because the
cursor that would re-derive it has already moved past the log that produced it. The only remaining
reclaimer is the (much slower) orphan-manifest sweep backstop, which drains roughly 100 objects per round
and cannot keep pace with a real burst.

Soak evidence: run-1 (cap=5000) left 112,518 entries skipped, of which 110,218 were still unreachable at
checkpoint time (checkpoint FAIL). Run-2 (cap disabled) fully drained all 223,714 entries in-round with
zero left unreachable (PASS). The user decision was that the knob must not exist at all — a cap here
converts a bounded burst into a permanent leak, which is worse than no cap.

**Fix direction, when someone takes it:** real bounding needs the edge-consumption point moved to AFTER
the delete succeeds (durable retry), not before it, so a cap-declined entry stays discoverable by the next
round's intake instead of being silently dropped. This is a natural fit for a future
`gc-frontier-one-list` focused session (post-Stage-B), since it touches the same intake/cursor machinery.

## `[soak-predown-textlog-scope]` `predown_dump.sh` only captures error-shaped `text_log` rows {#soak-predown-textlog-scope}

**Found by the T8 criterion-4 anomaly-arm injection** (Stage-B soak, `2026-08-03-stage-b-RESULTS.md`
`{#criterion-4-evidence}`): the GC round's own `INFORMATION`-level narration line — the exact text
explaining why destructive work was suppressed for that round, plus phase narration and hold-cause
detail generally — is not captured anywhere `predown_dump.sh` writes, because its `text_log` extract
(`text_log_error_shapes.tsv`) is scoped to error-shaped rows only. Once the cluster is torn down (or, as
here, simply reset for the next run), that narration is gone for good; the round's own structured
`system.content_addressed_garbage_collection_log` phase rows survived and carried the criterion, but the
human-readable confirmation did not.

**Fix direction:** `predown_dump.sh` should also capture `system.text_log` rows from the CAS loggers at
`Information` level, bounded by a time window and/or row cap (an unbounded dump risks turning the predown
step itself into the next `cas_log.tsv`-sized artifact). Not attempted here — recorded as a tooling gap
so the next investigation that needs this evidence doesn't rediscover the gap the hard way.

## `[damaged-object-diagnose-and-repair]` fsck must diagnose AND repair a damaged rebuildable object; the runbook must say how {#damaged-object-repair}

**Found by the T8 criterion-4 injection** (Stage-B soak; evidence pack
`.superpowers/sdd/2026-08-02-cas-stage-b-remaining/crit4-injection-evidence/`): a single namespace
checkpoint (`cas/ns/state/<life>/_ckpt`) was overwritten with garbage under a live writer. The GC fold
behaved exactly as designed — it detected the damage, classified the namespace as an anomaly/hold and
suppressed every irreversible family, round after round — but nothing in the product ever repaired the
object, and the live ref lane went to `CASRefNeedsRecovery` and stayed there for the remaining ~20
minutes of the run, including after the exact original bytes were restored. Byte-level damage to a
durable object is outside the trusted-store fault model this design assumes, so this is not a
correctness defect; it is an OPERABILITY hole: the system fails closed forever and hands the operator
no lever.

**What is missing, in priority order.**

1. **`ca-fsck` should diagnose the class precisely.** Today a damaged object surfaces as a suppressed
   GC round plus a counter; fsck's report has no row that says "namespace N's checkpoint is present but
   undecodable" (as distinct from absent, which is a legal cold-recovery state). Add the distinction:
   *present-and-undecodable* vs *absent* vs *decodable-but-inconsistent*, per affected object kind
   (`_ckpt`, fold seal, `gc/state`, catalog), naming the exact key.
2. **`ca-fsck --repair` (or an explicit sibling verb) should REBUILD what is rebuildable.** The
   checkpoint is a derived accelerator over the durable ref-log, so a damaged one is reconstructible by
   the same recovery walk the writer already implements (`recoverRefTableDetailed` / the recovery-epoch
   seal). The repair verb should: re-derive the object from its authoritative source, publish it by the
   ordinary CAS write path (no new object kinds, no protocol change), and refuse — loudly — for any
   object whose content is NOT derivable (a blob body, a committed ref-log record: those are the real
   data, and their loss is a restore-from-backup situation, not a repair).
3. **The lane must be able to leave `NeedsRecovery` once the source is sound again.** Our single
   observation says it did not, even after byte-identical restore. Whether that is a wedge, a
   remount-only exit, or an artifact of the injected shape is UNVERIFIED — determine it, and if the only
   exit is a remount, say so in the runbook and consider making recovery retry on its own.
4. **Runbook section: "a CAS object is damaged".** Operator-facing, in the numbered doc set, covering:
   how the condition ANNOUNCES itself (suppressed rounds naming the namespace, the fsck row from item 1,
   the `CASRefNeedsRecovery` counter); why there is no urgency (GC has already frozen everything
   irreversible — the pool is safe, it is just not reclaiming); the asymmetry an operator must know
   (an ABSENT checkpoint is a legal state that triggers cold recovery, a CORRUPT one is not — so the
   fallback of last resort is to DELETE the damaged derived object, never to hand-edit it); the repair
   sequence once item 2 exists; what NOT to do (`DROP POOL MEMBER` is for dead members, not damaged
   data; never hand-delete blob bodies or ref-log records; never "restore" bytes from an unofficial
   copy); and when the answer really is backup/restore because the damaged object is authoritative.

**Note on scope.** Items 1, 2 and 4 are operability work and need no protocol change. Item 3 may reveal
a real recovery-path defect; treat its outcome as its own item if so.

## [cas-join-set-truncate] `StorageJoin`/`StorageSet::truncate` throw retry-later, self-healing, on a CAS disk {#cas-join-set-truncate}

`StorageJoin::truncate` and `StorageSet::truncate` call `disk->removeRecursive(path)` then immediately
`disk->createDirectories(path)`. On a content-addressed disk `createDirectories` is a pure admission
no-op (`ContentAddressedTransaction::createDirectory` never touches the catalog), so the real re-mint
happens lazily on the first write after `TRUNCATE` returns — that write resolves the namespace through
`CasRefLedger::namespaceLife`.

**Verdict: TRANSIENT, not permanent.** A unit-level test
(`CASRefWriterNamespaceRemoval.FilesOnlyNamespaceTruncateThrowsRetryLaterUntilGcReclaimsThenRebirths` in
`src/Disks/tests/gtest_cas_ref_writer.cpp`) reproduces the exact sequence — birth a files-only
namespace life (the shape `StorageJoin`/`StorageSet` tables use, no MergeTree part ever published),
`dropNamespace` it (the `removeRecursive`-shaped call), then immediately call `namespaceLife` again on
the same name. It throws a typed `NETWORK_ERROR` ("CAS namespace … is Removing: creation waits for its
terminal fold and catalog removal to complete; retry later"), because the catalog row is still
`Removing` until a GC round actually deletes it. After draining GC (two rounds, same shape used
throughout this test file), the identical call mints a fresh incarnation and writes succeed normally —
self-healing, no operator action required.

Practically: `TRUNCATE` on a `StorageJoin`/`StorageSet` table backed by a CAS disk completes without
error (`removeRecursive`/`createDirectories` do not themselves touch `namespaceLife`), but the very next
write to that table (the next `INSERT`, or backup rewrite) throws a retry-later error until the
background GC round reclaims the just-removed row — a window bounded by GC round latency, not by
anything the client controls. A client without retry-on-`NETWORK_ERROR` will see the write it issues
right after `TRUNCATE` fail; retrying it (or simply waiting for the next GC round) succeeds.

**Before the `existsDirectory` fix** (the `DirShape::TableDir` cleanup-completeness probe), the same
`TRUNCATE` was silently a no-op on these engines: `existsDirectory` never reported the directory present
in the first place (it only answered "has at least one committed part", and these engines never publish
one), so `removeRecursive` was skipped entirely and the table kept its old contents. This is a change of
which wrong thing happens on `TRUNCATE`, not a newly introduced break: the old behavior silently ignored
the user's `TRUNCATE`; the new one executes it and imposes a bounded retry-later window on the following
write.

**Direction, not a fix here.** A real fix belongs in the CAS layer's rebirth semantics — either give
`namespaceLife` a fast, non-error path for "predecessor is provably terminal, just needs its row
folded" instead of forcing every caller through the GC-latency retry-later window, or have
`StorageJoin`/`StorageSet::truncate` itself wait for the removal to fully settle before returning
(mirroring `DROP TABLE ... SYNC`'s own synchronous-completion contract) rather than leaving the very next
write to discover the window. Out of scope for the fix-verify pass that found this; tracked here as a
usability rough edge, not a correctness defect.

## [disks-exit-code-upstream] `clickhouse-disks --query` non-interactive exit code — carve-out obligation {#disks-exit-code-upstream}

`DisksApp::main` now returns a failing command's error code as the process exit code for
non-interactive `--query` runs, so CI and cron can gate on `clickhouse-disks` at all. It **rides in the
CAS pull request for now** — pre-release, and the gating it enables is needed there — but it is a
behavior change to a shared tool for every user of it, so it must later be carved out into its own
upstream PR together with the integration-test fix it forces.

The record lives with the carve inventory, not here: `docs/superpowers/cas/upstream.md`, §G list plus
the G-item section below it (site, rationale, the two reviewer-facing details, the latent
`test_replicated_table_structure_alter` defect it exposed with its mechanism, and the blast-radius
conclusion).

## `[cas-tests-unchecked-optional-deref]` A test that dereferences a disengaged optional takes every later test in the binary with it {#cas-tests-unchecked-optional-deref}

A gtest that dereferences a disengaged `std::optional` does not fail — it aborts the process, and
every test scheduled after it in the same binary never runs. The gate then reports a smaller total
that still reads as green, so the regression that emptied the optional is invisible twice over: once
as its own missing failure, once as the suites it silently deleted from the run. This bit three times
in one night, each time presenting as "a suite disappeared" rather than as a failure.

The shape to write instead depends on the enclosing function's return type, and this is the part that
makes a blind `EXPECT_TRUE` → `ASSERT_TRUE` sweep wrong:

- **`void` test body** — `ASSERT_TRUE(x.has_value())` is correct and sufficient; `ASSERT_*` returns.
- **non-`void` helper** — `ASSERT_*` does not compile there (it expands to a bare `return;`). The
  helper must expect and then bail on its own: `EXPECT_TRUE(x.has_value()); if (!x) return {};`, or
  fold the guard into the value expression, `return x ? x->field : Field{};`. Both shapes already
  exist in the suite — `sealedCursorOf` and `holdOf` in `gtest_cas_gc_hold_grammar.cpp`, and
  `relinkTokenOf` in `gtest_cas_confirm_exact_ref.cpp` — and their comments state the reason.

**Measured on the branch at the time of writing**, not recalled: a scan for `const auto x = …`
followed within four lines by `x->` or `x.value()` with no intervening guard reports **13 candidate
sites** across 9 files, the largest groups being `gtest_ca_wiring.cpp`,
`gtest_cas_gc_frontier_gate.cpp`, `gtest_cas_orphan_nomination.cpp` and `gtest_cas_ref_writer.cpp`
(2 each). A first, naive version of the same scan reported 52 — the difference is entirely false
positives from shapes that ARE guarded: `if (const auto got = backend.get(…))`, and
`pending = e && e->delete_pending`. Any sweep must therefore be eyeballed per site, and the 13 are
candidates rather than confirmed defects; three were confirmed by reading
(`gtest_cas_lifecycle_condition.cpp:40`, `gtest_cas_orphan_nomination.cpp:180` and `:184`, each an
`EXPECT_TRUE` immediately followed by an unguarded `->`).

Separately, `EXPECT_TRUE(x.has_value())` appears 9 times against 401 `ASSERT_TRUE(x.has_value())`.
The `EXPECT` form is not wrong by itself — in a non-`void` helper it is the only option — but it is
the marker worth grepping for, because it is exactly where the author needed a guard and may have
stopped at the expectation.

The durable fix is not a one-off sweep: a sweep fixes today's sites and the next test written
reintroduces the class. What would actually close it is making the deref fail loudly at the point of
use — a checked accessor the CA test helpers use in place of `->` — so the shape is unavailable
rather than merely discouraged.

## `[gc-multidelete-conditional-gap]` batch `DeleteObjects` cannot replace GC's exact-token deletes as-is {#gc-multidelete-conditional-gap}

T9's destructive-baseline soak measured **944,155** individual `DiskS3DeleteObjects` calls across a
single 90-minute specimen's four destructive families (`pending_deletes`, `manifest_deletes`,
`ref_object_cleanup`, generation pruning inside `round_commit`) — every one a single-key
`removeObjectIfTokenMatches` call (`Backend::deleteExact`, `Backend/CasObjectStorageBackend.cpp:955`)
carrying an `If-Match` ETag precondition, the exact-token-match safety property that stops GC from
deleting a body a writer has already displaced (the CAS resurrection-safety invariant). ClickHouse
already has a working batch-delete path — `deleteFilesFromS3` (`IO/S3/deleteFileFromS3.cpp:80`,
default batch 1000, `IO/S3Defines.h:48`), reachable via `S3ObjectStorage::removeObjectsImpl` — but
no CAS delete-family call site uses it, including `deletePrefixWholesale`, which already LISTs a
whole prefix in pages and still deletes each listed key one at a time
(`Gc/CasGc.cpp:3563-3570`). The reason is not an oversight: the batch `DeleteObjects` request only
sets `Key` per `Aws::S3::Model::ObjectIdentifier` (`deleteFileFromS3.cpp:118-122`) — AWS's batch API
has no per-key conditional precondition, so wiring GC's existing calls to it as-is means dropping
the exact-token check, which is a correctness regression, not an optimization.

**Ceiling, if the conditional gap is ever closed** (e.g. a design that proves a delete cohort
collision-free at round-commit time without a per-key check): `944,155 → ⌈944,155/1000⌉ = 945`
batch requests, a >99.9% cut in delete request count. This is a REQUEST-COUNT ceiling, not a
wall-time prediction — the soak's backend (RustFS) measures ~650–700µs mean per-delete latency
(`DiskS3WriteMicroseconds`/`DiskS3DeleteObjects` ≈ 645µs for `pending_deletes` alone), far below
real S3 RTT, so the wall-time win against AWS S3 is unmeasured by this specimen and likely larger
than what RustFS would show.

**Falsification:** if no design can prove a cohort of exact-token deletes collision-free without a
per-key conditional (i.e. the safety property is fundamentally incompatible with a keys-only batch
API), this item stays permanently blocked and the correct scope is delete-side concurrency
(`[gc-delete-concurrency-serial]`) instead. Full measurement:
`docs/superpowers/reports/2026-08-04-gc-destructive-baseline-perf.md#opp-multidelete`.

**Closed by construction for the three write-once families** (manifest bodies, ref `_log`, ref `_snap`):
see `[gc-manifests-are-immutable-so-reduce-and-deletes-can-be-cheap]` and the design it points to. The
gap remains exactly as stated for blobs.

## `[gc-delete-concurrency-serial]` GC's destructive deletes run with almost no overlap {#gc-delete-concurrency-serial}

The same T9 baseline measured `pending_deletes` and `manifest_deletes` running near-serially
despite already dispatching through a thread pool: `pending_deletes` wall (208.77s, ch1) is 87% of
the SUM of its individual requests' `DiskS3WriteMicroseconds` (181.3s) — the requests overlap very
little. `manifest_deletes` shows the same shape (409.52s wall vs. 368.56s summed, 90%). Together
these two phases are 618.29s of ch1's 4352.1s total phase wall (14.2%) in this specimen. A bounded
worker pool issuing K concurrent conditional deletes (same shape as the existing `meta_pool`) could
plausibly cut this toward `wall/K`, independent of `[gc-multidelete-conditional-gap]` — the two
levers compose (concurrent batch calls) rather than compete, once/if the conditional gap closes.

**Falsification:** if concurrent deletes against the same backend/prefix trigger throttling
(RustFS or S3 `SlowDown`/503) at a K nobody has tried yet, the real win is smaller than linear —
this baseline never issued concurrent deletes and cannot rule that out. Full measurement:
`docs/superpowers/reports/2026-08-04-gc-destructive-baseline-perf.md#opp-delete-concurrency`.

## `[gc-fold-intake-readbuffer-head]` ✅ CLOSED by the request contract's read path (`e272e18f02c`, 2026-09-03) {#gc-fold-intake-readbuffer-head}

**Closed.** The backend's `read` no longer HEADs before it GETs: it goes through
`readSmallObjectAndGetObjectMetadata`, one `GetObject` whose own response carries the etag. The
2026-09-01 soak still shows the 1:1 pairing because its binary predates that commit; the first soak
against a later build is the confirmation. The rest of this entry is kept as the record of how the
pairing was found.

T9's baseline found `fold_ref_intake` — the single largest wall-time phase in a destructive round
(2303.0s of ch1's 4352.1s phase wall, 52.9%) — issuing `DiskS3GetObject` and `DiskS3HeadObject` in
an exact 1:1 pairing (1,183,381 each). This is NOT a regression of the predecessor's
`{#opp-fold-head}` (drop the HEAD in `foldManifestEdges`), which is confirmed delivered — the
source comment at `Gc/CasGc.cpp:1301-1312` states the HEAD was removed because the following GET
already carries the absence signal. The HEAD still visible here is a different, generic one:
`ReadBufferFromS3::getObjectSizeFromS3` (`IO/ReadBufferFromS3.cpp:463-469`) issues a `HeadObject`
to learn `Content-Length` before every ranged `GetObject`, for every S3 disk read in ClickHouse —
not CAS-specific.

**Not yet sized.** This entry only establishes that the pairing exists and where it comes from;
whether an existing known-size read-buffer constructor already avoids it on some call paths, and
what the real win would be, is unmeasured. **Falsification:** if the size-probe HEAD is required
for correctness on every generic S3 disk consumer (e.g. detecting a truncated/resized object
mid-read), this is a ClickHouse-wide question and does not belong on this CAS backlog at all. Full
measurement: `docs/superpowers/reports/2026-08-04-gc-destructive-baseline-perf.md#opp-fold-head-successor`.

## `[gc-intake-manifest-edge-serial-chain]` one manifest round trip per ref log is what `fold_ref_intake` still cannot overlap {#gc-intake-manifest-edge-serial-chain}

Measured (`docs/superpowers/worklogs/2026-09-04-cas-gc-fold-read-ahead-measurement.md`): with the fold
read-ahead on, `fold_ref_intake` improves by about 2.4x against a fixed per-request latency and then
stops, and the reason is a one-to-one count — 83 ref-log GETs against 83 manifest GETs in the measured
round. Ref-log keys are arithmetic, so the lookahead knows the next window of them before reading any;
a manifest key is named by the decoded body of the log that owns it, so the earliest the round can know
manifest N's key is after log N has been read AND decoded. Hinting "all the edges of this log" hints one
key whenever a log names one edge, which overlaps nothing with itself.

The fix needs a different mechanism than key arithmetic: decode an ALREADY-FETCHED later log purely to
learn its manifest keys and hint them, leaving the fold's own decode, its order and every decision
exactly where they are. That means a peek on the read-ahead that does not consume, and a speculative
decode whose failure must be discarded rather than acted on — the real decode still runs in order and
still holds the namespace at the right position. **Not sized**, and it is a design question rather than
a tactical one, which is why it is not part of the read-ahead change.

## `[gc-reduce-confirm-marker-read-ahead]` the graduation gate's meta re-check is the last serial read of `fold_reduce` {#gc-reduce-confirm-marker-read-ahead}

The fold's read-ahead (`GcReadAhead`, `cas_gc_read_concurrency`) now covers the checkpoints, the ref
logs, the manifest edges and the fresh zero-in-degree `HEAD`s. What remains serial in the reduce phase
is the graduation gate's `loadMeta` re-check, issued per carried condemned entry that has no in-process
confirmation — which, after a restart or a leadership change, is every entry graduating that round.
Its candidates are known only from the prior run's condemned sentinel rows, which the merge streams, so
hinting them needs a lookahead on the run cursor rather than a pre-pass over anything already in
memory. **Now sized enough to rank it:** with the zero-in-degree `HEAD`s read ahead, `fold_reduce` still
improves only about 1.2x against a fixed per-request latency, and this re-check is what it spends the
rest on (`docs/superpowers/worklogs/2026-09-04-cas-gc-fold-read-ahead-measurement.md`).

## `[gc-phase-rows-lose-worker-requests]` phase rows do not see requests made on worker pools {#gc-phase-rows-lose-worker-requests}

`GcPhaseTimer` diffs the round thread's `ProfileEvents`. Every request a read-ahead worker or a
`meta_pool` job performs lands on that worker's counters instead, so the S3 verb counts on
`fold_ref_intake` and `fold_reduce` now under-count by exactly the hinted requests — the same gap
`meta_pool_wait` has always had. The semantic metrics on those rows are unaffected, and
`CASGCReadAheadHit`/`Miss`/`Wasted` are on the row because they are incremented at the take site. The
fix is attribution at the worker boundary, which is a `GcPhaseTimer` change and not a read-ahead one.

## `[gc-reduce-zero-marker-dropped-on-carry]` a blob published during the reduce phase and then rolled back leaks until a rebuild {#gc-reduce-zero-marker-dropped-on-carry}

Raised by the head read-ahead consults (`docs/superpowers/worklogs/2026-09-03-cas-gc-head-read-ahead-consult.md`)
and NOT introduced by them. A blob observed absent when its `HEAD` is taken but present by the time the
merge closes it is not condemned that round, and the zero marker recording that is per-generation and
dropped on carry, so no later round re-examines the blob unless a delta touches it again. For ordinary
garbage this is correct: present-at-the-merge implies a publisher and therefore an edge. The residue is
a publication that lands mid-phase and then rolls back — that body has no edge and is never revisited.
The read-ahead widens the window quantitatively; it does not open the class. **Not sized**, and the fix
is a carried marker or a sweep concern rather than anything in the fold.

## `[decommission-waits-on-the-wrong-predicate]` `cas_mounts` liveness and `NoWait` decommission disagree about what "dead" means {#decommission-wrong-predicate}

`SYSTEM CAS DROP POOL MEMBER` under the `NoWait` policy refused a genuinely dead node in CI
(`test_cas_drop_pool_member::test_drop_dead_pool_member_heals_the_pool`, PR 2073, integration
amd_tsan 4/6), 15.5 seconds AFTER the target's lease wall-clock expiry:

```
CAS decommission 'node2': pool member is alive or contended -- mount lease held by
uuid=... epoch=1 pid=10 hostname=node2 (expires_at_ms=1785811895007). Refusing ...
```

This is not a stuck lease. The two sides use different definitions of dead, and each is right on its
own terms:

- **The observable one** is wall-clock: `CasServerRoot.cpp:236` computes `live = !gc_fenced &&
  expires_at_ms > now_ms`, and that is what a `cas_mounts` reader sees. The same file's own operator
  text carries a `CLOCK SKEW CAVEAT` about precisely this comparison.
- **The one reclaim requires** refuses that comparison outright. `claimMount`'s comment
  (`CasServerRoot.cpp:410-424`) says a same-uuid/different-epoch lease is reclaimed "ONLY on a
  certificate of death that needs no fresh wall-clock trust -- never by comparing `expires_at_ms`
  against `now_ms`": `gc_fenced`, the clean marker, or a `proven_dead_token`. A `kill=True` stop
  leaves none of the three, and `NoWait` passes an empty `proven_dead_token` (`CasPool.cpp:668`),
  skipping the observation wait that would mint one.

So the only route to `NoWait` success for a hard-killed node is a GC round fencing the dead mount
first. In the failing run GC rounds were executing on their ~1s cadence but reporting
`deferred`/`candidates=0` — the fence had not happened yet. The test's precondition polls
`cas_mounts.state != 'live'` for up to 90s, which the wall-clock definition satisfies on its own, so
passing that gate does not establish what the call it guards actually needs.

**Not yet decided, and the decision is the work here:** whether this is a test that waits on the wrong
predicate (fix: wait for the fence, or use the waiting policy), or a product gap (fix: `NoWait`
decommission should accept a hard-killed member without requiring GC to get there first, or say in
its refusal what the operator must wait for). Do not "fix" it by weakening the certificate-of-death
rule — that rule is what keeps a live twin from being decommissioned across two clocks.

Falsification: if a rerun passes on unchanged code, it is a cadence race rather than a deterministic
gap, which changes the fix but not the mismatch.

## `[gc-round-budgets-are-not-backpressure]` Round budgets throttle the consumer while the producer is unaware — the real fix is a time deadline {#gc-round-budgets-not-backpressure}

> Correction (2031-triage CAS-034, 2026-08-21): the title used to claim "four defaults changed" — those
> four budgets are still 5000 at HEAD, so the claim was stale and is removed rather than restated.

A per-round count cap is not backpressure. It bounds what GC does in one round while inserts and
merges — the producers of the work — know nothing about it. If arrival exceeds `budget × rounds/sec`,
the deficit is not smoothed, it accumulates. Whether that is harmless, degrading, or a leak depends
entirely on **what happens to the excess**, which turns out to differ per budget. Classified against
the code, not the names:

**A. Feedback loop (was capped, now unbounded).** `gc_round_graduation_budget`,
`gc_round_redelete_budget`. Excess is pushed back into `still_retired` "carry UNCHANGED"
(`CasBlobInDegree.cpp:472`), and the next round reads that list in full — `CasGc.h` marks the cost
`O(retired)`. So the round's cost grows with the debt while its useful work stays capped: rounds
lengthen, their rate drops, throughput drops, the debt grows faster. Worse than linear lag.

**B. Genuinely cursor-paced (unchanged, these caps are correct).** `manifest_sweep_list_budget_keys`,
`manifest_sweep_delete_budget_keys`, `gc_round_sweep_namespace_budget`,
`gc_round_sweep_recovery_op_budget`, `gc_round_prefix_wholesale_budget`. A cursor advances and never
regresses; a partially drained page or generation is simply finished next round. Nothing is
re-read, nothing accumulates. `gc_round_ref_cleanup_budget` is adjacent: it keeps no cursor but
`planRefCleanup` recomputes the same remaining candidates from durable state, so work is deferred,
not lost.

**C. A cap on one-shot work, i.e. a leak (was capped, now unbounded).**
`gc_round_handoff_prefix_wholesale_budget`. The struct's own comment says the hand-off "is a ONE-SHOT
event with no reclaimer behind it besides `fsck`: a generation it cannot fully reclaim this round is
never revisited (the parent-seal difference that triggers it does not recur)". This is the same shape
as the manifest-cleanup cap that was removed outright after a soak proved it leaked permanently.

**D. Audit loss (was capped, now unbounded).** `gc_round_outcome_entry_budget`. Nothing is retried on
exhaustion because the decision already happened; the only casualty is the audit row explaining it —
and it is dropped precisely on the busiest rounds, the ones an investigation would need.

**E. Not a throttle at all — an off switch (raised to effectively unbounded).**
`gc_frontier_probe_budget`. Exhaustion does not defer work: unprobed namespaces are simply unproven,
and one unproven namespace suppresses ALL destruction for the round (`CasGc.cpp:2047-2048`). It scales
with namespace count, i.e. with table count, so a value that is ample for ten namespaces becomes a
permanent GC stop for a large enough pool. **Its `0` cannot be redefined as "unbounded"**: unlike
every other budget here, `0` means "probe nothing", and the tests drive that exhaustion path
deliberately — so the default is spelled as a maximum instead. That inconsistency is itself an
operator trap and wants a proper sentinel.

**F. Memory bound, must stay capped.** `rebuild_edge_budget` — its comment is explicit that memory is
`O(budget)`, never `O(edges)`.

### What is still missing, and it is the real fix {#gc-budgets-need-a-deadline}

**A GC round has no time deadline anywhere in the code.** The count budgets have been serving as a
surrogate for one. That is why removing them is not free: a round holds the GC lease, and a round
that outruns the lease TTL gets fenced — the wedge class already fixed once in P3.1. The correct shape
is a per-round WALL-CLOCK deadline plus a cursor everywhere class A currently carries a list: the
round then does as much as it can inside its lease, stops cleanly, and resumes where it stopped
without re-reading the debt. Until that exists, the unbounded defaults above trade a silent
accumulation risk for a round-length risk, deliberately and with the user's decision.

Falsification for class A: with the caps off, a sustained-load soak should show round wall time
tracking arrival rate rather than climbing while `pending_condemned` climbs.

### Found during the 2026-08 documentation consolidation {#consolidation-2026-08-findings}

New items surfaced while writing/verifying the docs-consolidation pages (2026-08-01 to 2026-08-04);
continuing the ID series, not renumbering anything above.

- **[gate-filter-countingbackendshape-escape] ✅ CLOSED by renaming the suite to `CASCountingBackendShape` (`683b68606e2`, 2026-08-24)** — TEST/INFRA — The strict `CAS*` gate then passed `2141/2141` Debug tests from `298` suites and `2140/2140` ASan tests from `297` suites with zero sanitizer, leak, logical, fatal, or signal markers. The generator now emits the same `298`-suite strict set with the three remaining generic-infrastructure exclusions.
- **[gc-anomaly-never-emitted] `CasEventType::GcAnomaly` is defined but never emitted** — MINOR — Found during the deep-verification batch (batch-006): the event type exists in the enum but no call site constructs one, so any doc or dashboard describing GC-anomaly events as observable is currently wrong. Either wire an emit site or remove the dead enum value. (An orphaned 2026-08-04-triage finding on catalog/fold-seal capacity-reservation correctness is adjacent to this GC-observability gap — folded in as a related note, not a separate item.)
- **[reftxnid-wraparound-guard-missing] `nextRefTxnId` lacks a `UINT64_MAX` wraparound guard** — MINOR — Found during the deep-verification batch (batch-021, cluster C-0514): the sibling counter at `CasRefProtocol.cpp:941` has an explicit wraparound guard; `nextRefTxnId` does not. Add the matching guard or document why it is provably unreachable. (Confirmed 2026-08-04: this is the same finding as orphaned-open cluster C-0514 from the docs-consolidation triage — already tracked, not a separate item.)
- **[system-md-missing-cas-verbs] `SYSTEM CAS` verbs missing from `docs/en/sql-reference/statements/system.md`** — DOC — Found during Task 12 (operations runbooks): `SYSTEM CAS FSCK`/`FORGET`/`GC STOP`/`GC START` (and siblings) are documented in the CAS-specific pages but absent from the generic `SYSTEM` statement reference, where a user would naturally look first.
- **[casrequestcontrol-comment-settings-stale] `CasRequestControl` header comments cite settings that do not exist** — DOC — Found during the Task 12 fix round: the header comments name `cas_s3_retry_initial_backoff_ms`/`cas_s3_retry_max_backoff_ms` as if they were configurable settings; they exist only in the comment text — the real budget is hardcoded in `CasRequestBudget`. Either implement the settings or fix the comments to stop implying a configuration surface that isn't there.
- **[s3cache-config-comment-stale] stale comment in `utils/ca-soak/configs/storage_conf_s3cache_ch1.xml`** — MINOR — The comment claims cache-over-CA fails with `NOT_IMPLEMENTED`; this was fixed by `3ed0e5f5030` (2026-07-08) and the cache-over-CA path is now live-validated (see the quick-start cache example, `380688e8a66`). Remove the stale comment.
- **[part-folder-validate-never-gating] ✅ CLOSED by the retirement of `part_folder_validate` (`66b480241b7`, 2026-09-03)** — HARD (user settings-policy direction) — The setting this item demanded a gate for no longer exists: the manifest-cache-by-id work retired `part_folder_validate` entirely, so there is no `never` value left to silently accept. `RetiredPartFolderValidateIsRejected` pins that loading the retired name now throws `UNKNOWN_SETTING`.
- **[gc-enabled-false-silent] `gc_enabled=false` accumulates garbage silently** — HARD (user settings-policy direction) — Disabling the background GC scheduler produces no ongoing signal that reclamation has stopped. Add a periodic warning log line plus a metric while `gc_enabled=false` and the pool has reclaimable debris, so an operator who disabled GC for a legitimate reason (or by mistake) finds out before the pool grows unbounded.
- **[dedup-presence-only-window-recheck] ✅ CLOSED by the unconditional blob-publication rewrite (2026-08-23); kept for provenance** — The presence cache was deleted. Every blob decision now begins with an exact blob `HEAD`, validates the observed envelope-adjusted size, and only then adopts or publishes. The surviving local-store atomic-install debt is tracked in `BACKLOG/formats-and-storage.md`; it can fail publication or leave a bad object that the size check refuses, but cannot silently admit a truncated body.

## `[gcs-conditional-overwrite-rethink]` ✅ CLOSED: blob publication is unconditional and no longer GCS-capped {#gcs-conditional-overwrite-rethink}

Closed by the [unconditional blob-publication design](/superpowers/specs/cas-unconditional-blob-publication-design)
and its implementation on 2026-08-23. The historical problem was real: GCS does not enforce the
required destination precondition at multipart completion, so a conditional blob-body design either
needed a one-part ceiling or a more elaborate compose protocol. The implemented answer removes the
premise instead. Every blob decision starts with `HEAD`; an absent or `Condemned` body is then
published unconditionally. Fresh streaming uses ordinary multipart, and the first absent staged
publication may use native same-store copy. A `Condemned` or subsequent staged attempt retags and
streams so an already-queued exact delete cannot remove the new incarnation.

Consequently, blob bodies above the former ceiling are supported and do not use
`gcs_max_conditional_put_bytes`. That setting now applies to every conditional non-blob `PUT`,
including create-if-absent metadata/control artifacts and conditional replacements.
Native-conditional plumbing remains for those writes, native-token `HEAD`, and exact deletion; it
is not a blob-body transport.

Evidence is intentionally not overstated. The [real-storage results](/superpowers/cas/unconditional-blob-publication-live-results)
record complete test scenarios, but all 25 credentialed GCS cases skipped because credentials and the
TLS fault driver were unavailable; release readiness is blocked. `test_storage_s3` is also blocked by
the unavailable `clickhouse/clickhouse-server:23.3.19.33.altinitystable` image. The
[performance report](/superpowers/cas/unconditional-blob-publication-performance) records passing
target-only runs, but no matched same-environment pre-change binary; its control-adjusted sequence
ratios are not a code-version delta, so performance acceptance is also blocked pending a matched pair
and explicit human acceptance. The earlier cap/compose analysis remains in git history as the decision
record that led to this simpler protocol.


## `[gc-deferred-round-pays-full-list]` A Deferred GC round still pays the full ref-prefix listing — measured at 23% of server CPU under the parallel stateless lane {#gc-deferred-round-pays-full-list}

Measured live (2026-08-04, `system.trace_log` type=CPU, 10-minute window, evidence in the run's
`build/cpu_trace_diagnosis.md`): `CasGcScheduler::loop` appeared in 479/2097 (22.8%) of all sampled
CPU stacks and 70% of background-thread CPU. The single chain
`runRegularRound → enumerateRefPrefix → Backend::list → LocalObjectStorage::listObjects`
(`readdir`/`lstat`) was 11.7% — larger than any individual test query. Four test disks each ran a GC
round at ~1 Hz, and ~89% of those rounds finished `Deferred`: the full directory walk was paid every
second with no payoff.

Two independent contributors, each with its own fix:

1. **The listing is eager even when the round will defer.** The defer decision (fold threshold /
   nothing changed) is made AFTER enumerating. A cheap staleness probe before the walk — or feeding
   the defer decision from the previous round's cursor instead of a fresh enumeration — would make a
   quiet pool cost near nothing per round. This is the durable fix and applies to production pools,
   not just tests.
2. **The disks belonged to finished tests.** This is the known disk-lifecycle leak (custom disks are
   never torn down on `DROP TABLE`), here given a price for the first time: leaked 1 Hz schedulers
   from completed tests kept scanning for the rest of the run. The lifecycle redesign
   (`UNMOUNT` stops background work and ejects the disk) subsumes this half.

## `[gc-namespace-janitor-one-page-per-round-cannot-keep-up]` The namespace janitor examines one 1000-key page per round, so dead namespaces accumulate and every round's ref-prefix LIST grows with them {#gc-namespace-janitor-one-page-per-round}

Measured live (2026-09-04, `system.cas_gc_log` of the parallel stateless lane on the `cas_s3` disk,
`cas_gc_interval_sec = 5`, minio backend). Every regular round pays one LIST of `cas/ns/stream/` inside
`defer_decision` (three `system.stack_trace` samples of `CasGcSched` all sat in
`ObjectStorageBackend::listUnder`); the round is never `Deferred` on this disk, so
`[gc-deferred-round-pays-full-list]` does not apply — this is the FOLD round's fixed cost:

| window | rounds | avg `defer_decision` | keys listed | namespaces listed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 21:10 | 74 | 673 ms | 3 247 | 95 |
| 21:30 | 33 | 6 883 ms | 24 873 | 520 |
| 21:50 | 13 | 19 678 ms | 69 952 | 1 436 |

About 0.28 ms per key, i.e. ~280 ms per 1000-key page. At the end of the window 40 `MergeTree` tables
were alive while the LIST returned 1 404 namespaces with ~49 `_log` keys each: the prefix is almost
entirely dead namespaces of dropped test tables. `namespace_cleanup` (`runNamespaceJanitorPage`,
`janitor.runOnePage`) examines exactly one page per round (`janitor_pages = 1`, `janitor_keys = 1000`)
and deleted 150–300 keys per round, while the lane added ~27 000 keys per 10 minutes. Totals over the
46-minute run for `cas_s3`: `defer_decision` 889 s of ~1 830 s of GC wall time, then `fold_reduce`
393 s and `pending_deletes` 191 s. The pause between rounds (5 s) only divides the LIST count; the
janitor's page bound is what lets the LIST grow.

Proposed:

1. Give the janitor more than one page per round when the listing says the pool is debris-heavy —
   e.g. keep taking pages while the round's `namespaces_seen` exceeds the live-namespace count by an
   order of magnitude, bounded by a request budget, so a quiet pool still pays one page.
2. Lane config: raise `cas_gc_interval_sec` from 5 to 20 in (done 2026-09-04)
   `tests/config/config.d/cas_s3_storage_policy_for_merge_tree_by_default.xml` and
   `cas_storage_policy_for_merge_tree_by_default.xml`. The interval is a pause after the round, not
   a period; with 10 s rounds the scheduler ran two thirds of the time. Tests that need GC call
   `SYSTEM CAS GC` explicitly (18 tests) or configure their own disks with a 1 s interval, so they
   are unaffected. The product default (60 s) stays.

## `[cas-part-commit-runs-under-parts-lock]` On a CA disk the whole S3 publish of an inserted part (blob fan-out, manifest staging, ledger append) runs while `MergeTreeSink::commitPart` holds the table's `DataPartsLock`, so concurrent inserts into one table serialize on seconds of S3 I/O {#cas-part-commit-runs-under-parts-lock}

Measured 2026-09-04 on the parallel stateless lane (RustFS, binary 9bf134686af), table `dedup_test` of
`02434_cancel_insert_when_client_dies` / `02435_rollback_cancelled_queries` (many concurrent inserts into
one table): 61 inserts averaging 107 s, `PartsLockWaitMicroseconds` 3 528 s against
`PartsLockHoldMicroseconds` 195 s over a 270 s window, i.e. the lock was held 72% of the window by
inserts. Where the holder was (`system.trace_log` type `Real`, samples inside `commitPart` without a
`SharedMutex::lock` frame): `finalizeConditionalWrite < nativeConditionalPut < ... <
CasRefLedger::stagingPutIfAbsent < PartWriteTxn::stageManifest < ContentAddressedTransaction::publishStaging
< ContentAddressedTransaction::commit < DiskObjectStorageTransaction::commit <
DataPartStorageOnDiskFull::commitTransaction < MergeTreeData::Transaction::commit < MergeTreeSink::commitPart`
(246 samples), the same chain through `CasRefLedger::flushRefBatch` (263), `fanOutBlobUploads <
uploadPendingBlobs < publishStaging` (140). Of 12 634 samples on the test's query threads, 5 719 waited
for the lock and 717 held it inside the CAS commit.

Why: `MergeTreeSink::commitPart` takes `lockParts()` (`MergeTreeSink.cpp:376`), calls
`renameTempPartAndAdd` with `rename_in_transaction=false` and then `transaction.commit(lock)`
(`:408`) inside the same scope. On a plain object-storage disk that commit is local metadata work; on
a CA disk `ContentAddressedTransaction::commit` is where the blobs are uploaded (fan-out, HEAD-before-PUT),
the manifest is staged (conditional PUT) and the ref-ledger append is flushed, about 1 to 3 s per part
at 54 ms per PUT. Every concurrent insert into the table waits for that. The upstream comment above
the call says the rename must stay under the lock (covered-parts race with merges), so the lock scope
itself is not ours to move (upstream-coupling rule).

Fix direction (CAS side only): perform the upload half before the lock. The blob fan-out and the
manifest staging depend only on the part's content, which is final when the writer finalizes, so they
can run at write-buffer finalize / `finalizePart` time (before `commitPart` takes the lock), leaving
only the ledger publish (one combined `_log` write per flush batch) under the lock. Check the
replicated sink (`ReplicatedMergeTreeSink.cpp:1022-1053`) for the same shape before deciding the
seam. Verification: rerun the two tests on the lane and read `PartsLockHoldMicroseconds` per insert;
the general win is every multi-writer table on CA storage, not just these tests.

## TASK `[gc-condemn-head-read-ahead-pinned-window]` Free the condemn-time HEAD read-ahead window when the merge passes hinted keys, so mass-removal rounds stop paying inline HEADs {#gc-condemn-head-read-ahead-pinned-window}

**Measured 2026-09-04, real-AWS smoke soak (`ca_live_20260904_aws_r1`, binary 9bf134686af, `cas_gc_read_concurrency` 16, window 64):**

| round | condemned | inline `HEAD` | `CASGCReadAheadHit` | `Miss` | `Wasted` | `fold_reduce` |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 20:54 | 1261 | 860 | 2453 | 862 | 64 | 128 s |
| 20:56 | 882 | 771 | 583 | 774 | 64 | 116 s |
| 21:09 | 1793 | 882 | 3146 | 4 | 19 | 42 s |

Misses equal the inline HEAD count and `Wasted` is exactly the window: the 64 slots hold hints the
merge never takes, `topUpHeadHints` (`Gc/CasGc.cpp:1801`, `while (pending() < window())`) hints nothing
more, and every `takeHead` at `:1828` degrades to a serial HEAD at ~150 ms on AWS. The third round shows
the same code with a free window: 1793 condemns in 42 s. Same signature as the GCS runs recorded under
`[gc-manifests-are-immutable-so-reduce-and-deletes-can-be-cheap]` (`Wasted=64` per round,
`epoch_crossings=0`), so this is the mechanism that pins the window without an epoch crossing.

**Task.** `head_candidates[shard]` is a superset of the keys the merge will actually take, in the
merge's own ascending key order (comment at `Gc/CasGc.cpp:1790`). A hinted key the merge has already
passed can never be taken. Rule at the hinting site: before topping up, and on any `takeHead` miss with
`pending() == window()`, `discardHead` every pending hint whose key sorts before the key being taken
(the read-ahead counts them as wasted, which is the honest figure). Then top up. Add a gtest that
builds a candidate superset with gaps and asserts hits/misses/wasted per round against the sequential
oracle, plus the existing `CAS*` gate. Acceptance: on a mass-removal round `Miss` is within one window
of zero and `fold_reduce` scales with the read-ahead, not with the inline HEAD count. Expected on the
AWS figures above: 128 s → ~40 s.

## TASK `[gc-pending-deletes-fan-out]` Fan the blob `pending_deletes` loop out over a bounded worker pool; each blob keeps its exact-token HEAD + conditional DELETE {#gc-pending-deletes-fan-out}

**Measured 2026-09-04, real-AWS smoke soak:** `pending_deletes` 351 s for 1261 blobs and 246 s for 882
(one HEAD ≈100 ms plus one single-key conditional `DeleteObjects` ≈150 ms per blob, serial, ~0.28 s per
blob); with `fold_reduce` above, these two phases made the 427 s and 328 s rounds that the soak harness'
300 s fixpoint bound cannot survive (`history=[3517, 2779]`). GCS run 2 showed the same at 551 s for
2731 blobs (`[gc-blob-pending-deletes-now-dominant]`); the T9 baseline showed it at 208 s
(`[gc-delete-concurrency-serial]`). Those two entries are the measurement; this is the task.

**Task.** The loop at `Gc/CasGc.cpp:700` does per blob: `op.head` → token compare → `op.remove(key,
observed etag)` → event, outcome row, meta scheduling. The network pair is independent per key and its
safety is per key (I5: exact-token delete; a resurrected blob mismatches and is left alone), so
concurrency changes nothing about safety. Shape: chunks of N = `cas_gc_read_concurrency` entries from
`redelete_now`; each worker runs head → compare → remove through an operation resumed under the round's
admitted generation, exactly as `GcReadAhead` workers do, so a fence that moves under the round fails the
worker's request the way it fails the main one; the worker returns `(Removal, observed)`; the owning
thread then runs the existing bookkeeping serially in the original order. `authority_held` is checked
before each chunk, as the serial loop checks it per entry. Not the read-ahead: that design never runs
the destructive decision, and this task keeps that rule (the decision and the delete run in the worker
only because they are one exact-token request; nothing is prefetched). Tests: a gtest with an
instrumented backend asserting that N deletes overlap, that a fence mid-chunk stops the remaining
chunks with no delete issued after it, that a mismatch during the chunk is `Replaced` and leaves the
object, and that outcomes/events/meta calls are identical to the serial loop's; the `CAS*` gate; a
soak round with mass removal reading `pending_deletes` from `system.cas_gc_log`. Acceptance: phase wall
≤ 2 × (serial wall / N) on the AWS stand; no change in `objects_deleted`/`spared`/`replaced` counts
for the same input. Falsification stays as in `[gc-delete-concurrency-serial]`: SlowDown/503 at a
concurrency nobody has tried; start with N = 8 and measure.

**Worth checking first, separately:** AWS added conditional deletes; if `DeleteObjects` accepts a
per-key ETag condition that general-purpose buckets enforce, the whole phase becomes one request per
1000 blobs. A store capability, so it would have to be proven by the capability probe the way the
exact-token DELETE 412 is proven today; not assumed.

## `[emulated-resurrect-should-spill-to-disk]` Emulated `publishBlob` should spill before atomic install {#emulated-resurrect-spill-to-disk}

**REFRAMED 2026-08-23; identifier and history preserved.** The separate resurrection API was deleted.
The remaining debt is `ObjectStorageBackend::publishBlob` in `EmulatedSingleProcess` mode: it
materializes the complete `[header][payload]` body before installing it. This retains complete-object
visibility and bounds concurrency, but peak memory is still the largest single blob even though the
backing store is a local disk.

Atomic install itself is already implemented by `emuPublishBlobAtomically`: the fully materialized
body is written to a sibling temporary object and renamed into place under `emu_mutex`. The separate
remaining follow-up is to stream directly to that temporary file (or the pool scratch path), validate
the declared size, and retain airtight cleanup on success, size mismatch, and mid-stream exception.
This is emulated-mode peak-memory work only; native S3/GCS `publishBlob` already streams or uses
native copy and is not affected.

## CAS-021 (issue #2207) adjudication follow-ups: controller-outcome honesty + condemn-memo staleness (2026-08-20) {#cas-021-followups}

Adjudication of https://github.com/Altinity/ClickHouse/issues/2207 (two read-only code sweeps against
HEAD `684161dcc03`; updated for the 2026-08-23 rewrite): the controller-outcome observation remains
relevant to mutable blob metadata, but the old conditional body-displacement branch was deleted. The
claimed integrity consequence remains neutralized — the delete path is guarded by the normative
delete-site in-degree re-read, exact-token deletion cannot remove a fresh retagged publication, and
the writer checks its admitted fence generation before publication;
the equality-resolved meta etag is consumed by NOBODY (`writeCondemnedMeta` reads only `.outcome`);
the ref-log lane adjudicates authorship by byte equality over a payload that carries txn identity
(`classifyRefLogOccupant`, `CasRefLedger.cpp:2240`); a false-`Occupied` → mount-fault path does not
exist. GC's gate predicate is "durable Condemned evidence exists" — which the equality-resolve GET
literally proves — same as the already-Condemned arm at `CasGc.cpp:137`.

Follow-ups, in recommended packaging:

- (1) **Honesty patch over the request controller** (one coherent change, NO durable-op/wire/behavior
  change): split the equality-resolved outcome out of `Committed` (e.g. `IntendedStateDurable`), stop
  returning the observed occupant token on that arm (it claims authorship no caller has; today unused
  — make that structural); rename `slotOccupy`'s misleading `NotUnresolved` label; add the
  "trust model" doc-block at the resolution ladder (what equality-resolve proves / does not prove,
  pointers to the three system invariants that make it safe) and the ownership-decidability table by
  key class (immutable content-addressed / mutable identity-in-payload / mutable identity-free /
  owner-anchor `claimOwnerOrThrow`); cross-reference sentences at `writeCondemnedMeta` ("a foreign
  `Condemned` marker satisfies the predicate by design") and `reconcileMetaClean` ("an
  equality-resolved desired `Clean` record is already durable");
  rename the pin tests to read as spec. ~150-250 line diff + test renames; controller = adversarial
  review mandatory. This addresses the CORE of CAS-021 at the type level: the external auditor's
  reading becomes impossible to write.
- (2) **Stale condemn-marker memoization — ACCEPTED RESIDUAL, do NOT fix with re-reads** (user
  decision 2026-08-20): the in-process `condemn_markers_confirmed` note survives a legitimate
  `Condemned -> Clean` transition (no `forgetCondemnMarker` on writer replacement without an intervening fold),
  so `confirm_condemned_marker` (`CasGc.cpp:1885`) can graduate an entry whose durable meta says
  Clean. Consequence when it fires (ultra-rare race): ONE spurious `deleteExact` — an S3 DELETE,
  which is FREE — self-healing at `CasGc.cpp:862-870` (TokenMismatch drops the confirmation, meta
  untouched). The re-read fix would cost +1 BILLABLE GET per graduating condemned entry on the
  COMMON path (P9 GET-budget class) to save free DELETEs in a rare race — worse than the disease.
  No zero-cost invalidation exists either (the window is by definition "nothing observed the fresh
  replacement"). Only sanctioned improvement: the observability LABEL at the self-heal site (counter/
  log as "spared by token rotation", not an anomaly) — zero extra requests; fold into (1) if done.
- (3) One trust-model paragraph for conditional writes in the numbered doc set
  (`03-writer-protocol.md`) — documentation only.

## Issue #2233 adjudication residue: soak-harness observability + Poco shared-pool risk (2026-08-20) {#issue-2233-followups}

Adjudication of https://github.com/Altinity/ClickHouse/issues/2233 ("replica HTTP dies on green-path soak
after relink NETWORK_ERROR storm"): the refusal storm is the known, designed
`{#relink-confirm-busy-lane}` behavior (all four remediations there still open — the per-ref rule-3
refinement is the availability fix); the claimed causality "storm -> HTTP death" is contradicted by our
own artifacts (a 90-minute phase-3 soak absorbed 112,598 refusals — peak 9,219/min — and ended
`PHASE3 OK` with both replicas alive; the reporter saw ~278 total), and no fd/socket/thread leak exists
on the abandoned-relink path (drain-then-throw + `SCOPE_EXIT` verified). Prime suspects for the
reporter's observation: VM-level OOM (28g `mem_limit` x2 on a 16 GiB Docker Desktop VM; their upstream-
compose symptom was "Connection refused after the peer exits") and the Poco shared-`server_pool`
silent-refusal upstream bug (below). Items:

- (1) **ca-soak compose: `ch2` has NO healthcheck** (`docker-compose.yml` — only `ch1` has the HTTP
  `/ping` probe, added for capability-probe serialization). "Container healthy while HTTP dead" on ch2
  is therefore vacuous. Add the same healthcheck to ch2. Trivial.
- (2) **soak driver: `TRANSPORT FAILURE` is an `else`-branch catch-all** (`soak/run.py:2020-2026`) that
  names a subsystem it never diagnosed — the same triage-misdirection failure mode #2219 complains
  about, one layer up. Phase 1 additionally does exactly one attempt (`transport_resilient=False`) and
  checkpoints do not gate on HTTP health (phase-2-only wait), so any transient `OSError` becomes the
  issue's exact headline. Split the label (name the errno/op) and consider a phase-1 HTTP-health gate
  at checkpoints. Small.
- (3) **Poco shared-`server_pool` silent connection refusal — assess exposure** (upstream bug, comment
  in `base/poco/Net/src/TCPServerDispatcher.cpp:154-180`): one `Poco::ThreadPool` capped at
  `max_connections` is shared by 8123/HTTPS/native/9009; `_currentThreads` is per-dispatcher, so
  saturation by long-lived interserver byte fetches can make the 8123 dispatcher drop accepted sockets
  with NO ClickHouse-level error (client sees RST; at most a Poco `Warning`). Relink-storm second-order
  effect: refusals suppress zero-byte relinks and FORCE long byte fetches, i.e. the storm converts
  cheap transfers into thread-holding ones. Candidate observability first: expose refused-connection
  counts / alarm on pool saturation before considering upstream surgery (upstream file = consult-first).
- (4) **Confirm-path observability gaps** (feeds `{#relink-confirm-busy-lane}` items (b)/(c)): no
  ProfileEvents pair for proven/refused confirms; refusal reason (which rule) logged only at Debug on
  both sides; the receiver collapses refusal vs transport failure vs timeout into one message — the
  reporter's logs could not distinguish them even in principle. This adjudication would have taken
  minutes with (b)+(c) implemented.

## Issue #2243 CONFIRMED: local port exhaustion fences out the mount lease (2026-08-20) {#issue-2243-port-exhaustion-lease}

https://github.com/Altinity/ClickHouse/issues/2243 — read-heavy concurrent `SELECT FINAL` on a CAS
default-policy disk exhausts the container's ephemeral ports (errno 99 `EADDRNOTAVAIL`), which kills
the mount-lease renewal → fence → `TransientNotLive` → ~42 s full-disk refusal → self-remount discards
in-flight `PartWriteTxn`s. CONFIRMED REAL (adjudicated from code; mechanism matches our own S07 finding
from 2026-07-06). The rev.8 fail-close chain itself worked exactly as designed; the defects are in the
trigger and its classification.

Mechanism (verified at file:line): the S3 client keep-alive default is 5 s (`S3Defines.h:12`); pooled
DISK connections expire at 0.8×5 s idle (0.1×5 s once the group crosses `disk_connections_soft_limit`),
`mustReconnect` resets any connection whose request STARTED > 4.5 s ago, and `http_keep_alive_max_requests`
rotates every 100 requests. With P pooled connections and R req/s, reuse survives only while P/R < 4 s —
concurrent FINAL prefetch puts P in the dead band, so nearly every request connects fresh and the CLIENT
closes on return → TIME_WAIT at request rate (reporter: ~430 GET/s × 60 s ≈ 26k of 28,232 ports). The
store honoring keep-alive is irrelevant. Retry amplification: `EADDRNOTAVAIL` is classified as remote
transient at EVERY layer (Poco → `CoreErrors::NETWORK_CONNECTION` → retryable; CAS controller →
`Unresolved`); reads ride `s3_retry_attempts=500`. Lease renewal = ONE bare single-attempt PUT per 10 s
through the same DISK pool (no reserve, no controller budget — WEAKER than any data write); outage length
is constructive: `mountObservationThresholdMs = ttl + 5% + cadence = 36.5 s` (field answer to
{#fence-window blast radius}'s "measure where remount time goes").

Fix directions, in value order:
- (1) **Classify local socket-resource errors as local** (`EADDRNOTAVAIL`, `EMFILE`, `ENFILE`): hard
  backoff instead of retry-at-rate. Template = the existing DNS sub-classification branch
  (`PocoHTTPClient.cpp:840`); CAS side maps it out of `Unresolved`'s full budget. Retry loops are the
  positive-feedback term — this cuts the amplifier.
- (2) **Mount-lease resilience**: in-period fast retry (today a failed renewal waits the FULL next
  period — `CasServerRoot.cpp:1437` `continue` re-enters `wait_for(period)`), and/or reserved
  connection / dedicated small budget for the renewal PUT. Note the margin arithmetic: ttl=30s /
  period=10s / margin=2s allows at most TWO ride-out warnings per lease generation, not three.
- (3) **Keep-alive defaults for CAS-over-S3 profiles**: 5 s TTL + 100-request rotation is the churn
  engine under sustained read concurrency; evaluate raising `http_keep_alive_timeout` (60 s) and
  `http_keep_alive_max_requests` in the CAS disk profile / docs. Caveat: the server-advertised
  `Keep-Alive: timeout=N` header mins the client value (`HTTPClientSession.cpp:377`) — capture what
  RustFS advertises first. Diagnostic BEFORE any change: `DiskConnectionsCreated/Reused/Expired/Reset/
  Preserved` + `DiskConnectionsTotal/Stored` (prediction: Created≈request rate, Expired>>Reset, Stored≈0;
  if Reset>>Expired the cause is the non-drained-body branch and the fix belongs in the read path).
- (4) NOT a fix: capping pool limits below the ephemeral range (reporter's #1) — limits gate KEEPING,
  not CREATING; TIME_WAIT is invisible to them (hence errno 99, never `HTTP_CONNECTION_LIMIT_REACHED`);
  lower caps flip the pool into the 0.5 s TTL regime sooner and worsen churn.

Housekeeping folded in:
- **S07 wide-part port-exhaustion finding re-rated**: was closed 2026-07-06 as "cost/latency only, not a
  data bug" (`performance.md:131`, DESIRABLE) — #2243 refutes that scope: the same condition takes the
  LEASE down and discards in-flight write txns. Availability class, not just cost.
- **[B196] is stale as written**: `s3_max_connections` is dead code for the disk path (an AWS-SDK
  `ClientConfiguration` field; `PocoHTTPClient` never reads `maxConnections`) — the disk path is governed
  by `disk_connections_*` + keep-alive, and NONE of those caps concurrent socket creation either.
- **Soak-harness blind spot**: `soak/cluster.py` classifies "mount lease not held" as retryable
  `NETWORK_ERROR` — our own soaks would ride through a #2243 event and score it recoverable; add a
  lease-loss detector (count `TransientNotLive` windows / `CasMountLeaseKeeper` errors) to checkpoints.

## Issue #2244 (filed by us): lease/remount retry asymmetry — CI RCA of job 96307284077 (2026-08-20) {#issue-2244-lease-retry-asymmetry}

https://github.com/Altinity/ClickHouse/issues/2244 — full RCA in the issue. Before the minimum fix, the
two operations keeping a CAS mount alive were the only S3 operations without retries: renewal sent
one 5-second-timeout `PUT` per 10-second period, while remount claim used `SingleAttempt` inside a
roughly 15-operation sequential chain with a 36.5-second observation window. An intermittent-timeout
episode that the data plane rode out on `Attempt 2/501 succeeded` therefore tripped the fence and cost
roughly 15 minutes of full-disk write refusal. This was field evidence #2 for
{#fence-window blast radius} and {#fence-window observability}.

Fix directions (tracked in the issue, value order): (1) in-period renewal retries while
`now + margin < confirmed_deadline` — would have prevented this trip outright; (2) per-step retries in
the remount chain + investigate the own-ambiguous-claim observation-window reset (STID-3982 family);
(3) observability: log the trip reason + every remount attempt step at default level, ProfileEvents
for renewals/remounts; (4) rate-limit the snapshot-publication refusal loop (125,952 warnings/16 min
on one table — NEW defect, no backoff on that loop). CI-env extra: RustFS logs at ERROR-only — raise
its log level in the CA lanes (re-opens the [CAS CI observability gaps] rustfs item at the level
dimension).

The minimum pre-release fix is specified in
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-23-cas-mount-renewal-retry-design.md`: ambiguity-aware in-period
renewal retries, renewal/remount observability, and the snapshot-refusal backoff hole. It deliberately
does not change the remount protocol. **Implemented 2026-08-24:** the minimum cut and its focused/full
TLA+, Release/Debug, proxy-integration, and 15-minute S39 gates are complete. The separately anchored
per-step remount follow-up below remains open.

### Issue #2244 follow-up: per-step remount recovery {#issue-2244-remount-retry-follow-up}

After the minimum renewal fix, replace whole-chain remount retry with an explicitly modeled state
machine. Required design questions: per-step retry classification; which owner/catalog/epoch results
may be preserved; whether an own ambiguous claim preserves or resets token-stability observation;
prevention of repeated epoch burning; cancellation at every teardown boundary; and deterministic
fault injection before/after every state-changing step. This is safety-critical single-writer work and
requires its own focused TLA+ gate plus a refinement audit against `CaCasMountCore`; do not fold it into
the minimum renewal implementation without that design review.

Triage bonus recorded: the RustFS "Erasure decode failed ... downstream_closed" error class is a red
herring = ClickHouse's silent-by-design mid-body aborts (cancellations, LIMIT, abandoned prefetch);
do not chase it in future triage.

## CAS disk settings whitelist rejects valid S3 keys (found by #2243 mitigation attempt, 2026-08-20) {#cas-disk-s3-key-whitelist-gap}

Field report (Carlos, clickhouse-regression run 32408309167/job 96552561919): adding
`<http_keep_alive_timeout>60</http_keep_alive_timeout>` to a CAS disk block — the mitigation
suggested in #2243 — kills the server at startup with `Unknown setting 'http_keep_alive_timeout'
(UNKNOWN_SETTING)` during metadata loading.

Mechanism: on a CAS disk the S3 keys are direct children of the same block as the CAS settings, and
`ContentAddressedSettings.cpp` fail-closes on any key that is neither a CAS setting nor in the
`non_cas_keys` whitelist. The whitelist was built by enumerating in-repo configs, so it contains only
the S3 keys those configs happened to use — `http_keep_alive_timeout` and
`http_keep_alive_max_requests` (both genuinely consumed on the disk path,
`ObjectStorages/S3/diskSettings.cpp:169-170`) are missing, as is every other unused-in-repo
`S3AuthSettings` key (`connect_timeout_ms`, `max_connections`, `session_token`, ...). No workaround
exists: the disk path reads S3 auth settings only from the disk block
(`S3Settings::loadFromConfigForObjectStorage`), never from the global `<s3>` per-endpoint section.

Fix: instead of growing the enumerated whitelist, skip every key whose name is a builtin
`S3AuthSettings` or `S3RequestSettings` name (BaseSettings exposes the builtin-name enumeration),
keeping `non_cas_keys` only for the genuinely ad-hoc generic-disk-layer keys (`type`, `name`,
`use_fake_transaction`, ...). Update the four-way-scan comment accordingly. Release-relevant: this
blocks the #2243 CI mitigation on CAS disks.

## Issue #2211: `SYSTEM CAS GC RUN` on a follower silently does nothing (adjudicated 2026-08-21) {#issue-2211-gc-run-follower-noop}

https://github.com/Altinity/ClickHouse/issues/2211 — CONFIRMED as described; the report's code anchors
all check out on HEAD. History splits it in two:

1. **No-steal on manual runs is DELIBERATE** — commit `74d67b85021` (2026-07-13, "manual GC rounds
   never steal a lease"): the observation-window steal protocol's safety argument needs the two
   "incumbent frozen" observations spaced by real wall time (the loop's paced ticks); two manual
   calls can land microseconds apart and fake a frozen incumbent → two concurrent destructive GC
   actors. The pre-fix manual path also never heartbeat-protected an acquired lease. Keep as is;
   the issue itself agrees steal is the wrong fix.
2. **The silent success row was NOT a chosen contract** — commit `cb111510c1a` (2026-07-20) merely
   surfaced the already-computed `RoundReport` as a result set ("mirroring the DROP POOL MEMBER
   precedent", deferred-register item 11). No record anywhere (commits, specs, backlogs) weighs
   throw-vs-row for the follower case; the docs (`operations/debugging.md` `{#sql-gc-run}`) don't
   mention the follower no-op either. Genuine operator-contract gap.

Also confirmed: `GcLease` is `{owner: UInt128 random gc_id, seq}` — no host identity
(`CasGcStateFormat.h:17`), and `system.cas_mounts.is_leader` is populated only for the local mount,
so a follower cannot name the leader today.

Fix shape (DECIDED 2026-08-21, user call): keep the quiet idempotent OK — no exception. Rationale:
with default `distributed_ddl_output_mode=throw`, a throwing follower inverts the bug for
`ON CLUSTER` (leader ran the round, N-1 followers threw, the statement reports failure), and a node
inside the DDL fan-out cannot tell it is part of `ON CLUSTER`, so selective throwing is impossible.
A follower's "not my lease" is a valid outcome of "run a round here if this node may", and quiet OK
keeps scripts/harnesses that poke `RUN` on every node working. Instead, make the outcome
first-class and visible:
- add a `finish` column (`Success`/`NotALeader`/`Deferred` — already exists in `cas_gc_log`, the
  interpreter row just doesn't emit it) to the `RUN` result set, so the operator reads a word, not
  infers from `acquired_lease=0` + zeros;
- add advisory identity to `GcLease`, mirroring the existing `MountLease` precedent
  (`CasServerRootFormats.h` carries `hostname`/`pid`/`server_uuid` next to its protocol fields for
  exactly this purpose): `hostname` (+ `server_uuid`/`pid` for symmetry), written at acquire/steal.
  The protocol part stays untouched — `owner` MUST remain a random per-process-instance UInt128
  (a restarted server is a NEW GC actor and must not resume the old lease; hostname is neither
  unique nor per-instance), which is WHY host identity was never the owner: the advisory field was
  simply never needed until #2211 (YAGNI, not a considered rejection — no record deciding against
  it). Durable-format change, pre-release so no compat scaffolding
  ([[feedback_ca_no_compat_scaffolding_predev]]);
- follower `RUN` row then carries `leader_host` — `NotALeader, leader_host='replica-2'` in one read,
  no operator discovery query. Rejected as contract (user call): documenting a
  `clusterAllReplicas(system.cas_mounts) WHERE is_leader=1` discovery recipe as the way to find the
  leader — too strange a requirement once the row can name the holder;
- bonus: `system.cas_mounts.is_leader` can be populated for ALL rows (match `gc/state`
  hostname/server_uuid against mount slots), not local-only;
- docs `{#sql-gc-run}`: state the leadership model in one sentence.
No-steal on manual `RUN` stays untouched.

## Reviewer ask: full-word wire keys in all CAS persisted formats (2026-08-21, RESOLVED 2026-08-30) {#wire-keys-full-words}

Reviewer feedback: after the move to JSON text formats, the 2-5-char field keys (`su`, `eat`, `fen`,
`nwe`, ...) are illegible and force manual remapping when reading raw objects. Wanted: human-readable
identifiers everywhere, matching the struct/enum names, no mapping table needed.

Resolved by `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-28-cas-semantic-wire-keys-design.md`, shipped as the
semantic-wire-keys generation reset: every persisted key became a "sufficiently full" semantic word
(metadata written once per object gets a descriptive name; fields repeated once per record get a
short semantic word; enum values render as full words). Exact full C++ member names everywhere —
the reviewer's literal ask — were deliberately REJECTED for repeated records and for the fixed
`cas_blob` descriptor: the design's "Rejected alternatives" section records why, and points at the
Altinity PR #2288 implementation of the rejected alternative as a worked illustration of the cost
(the descriptor no longer fits the default payload offset, and the raw uncompressed formats grow
materially). `Formats/README.md` carries the naming rule the reviewer originally quoted.

## Issue #2219: relink refusals logged at Error with stack trace (adjudicated 2026-08-21, fix queued) {#issue-2219-relink-refusal-log-level}

https://github.com/Altinity/ClickHouse/issues/2219 — CONFIRMED, cosmetic but worth fixing (the issue
documents a multi-hour false triage chasing a network fault that wasn't there; up to 53% of relink
proofs refuse under small-part load, each printing `Error` + stack trace + `NETWORK_ERROR`).

Mechanism: the throw site is fine (`DataPartsExchange.cpp` taxonomy row 3, ~:1550 — deliberately
thrown so the byte-fallback does NOT run); the noise comes from the generic queue handler
`StorageReplicatedMergeTree::processQueueEntry` (:4224-4239), whose demotion list
(`NO_REPLICA_HAS_PART`/`ABORTED`/`PART_IS_TEMPORARILY_LOCKED` → `LOG_INFO`, no stack trace) does not
know this code. `NETWORK_ERROR` is NOT load-bearing on this path — no `e.code()` branch in the queue
or fetch path tests it; "retry-later" is the default for any stored exception.

FIXED 2026-08-26 (`081c473904e`; branch `cas-relink-refusal-classification` for the antalya-26.6
PR). The code chosen is `NO_REPLICA_HAS_PART`, not the `ABORTED` this record originally planned: both
are in the demotion lists of BOTH queue executors (`processQueueEntry` AND
`ReplicatedMergeMutateTaskBase::executeStep` — the second one matters for merge-entries executed as
fetch), but `ABORTED` also sets `need_to_save_exception = false`, the exact
"treated as not an error, no backoff engages" pathology `[merge-progress-reset-mount-fence]`
documents; `NO_REPLICA_HAS_PART` keeps the exception on the queue entry. It is also the one
fetch-transient code stateless `part_log` hygiene checks whitelist (`02265_column_ttl` broke in the
CAS lanes on exactly this: PR #2159 CI, 13/14 reruns under `prefer_fetch_merged_part_size_threshold=1`).
Verified: the only two `e.code() == NO_REPLICA_HAS_PART` branches in the tree are those demotions;
`enqueuePartForCheck` keys on `replica.empty()`, not the code. Original plan text follows for
provenance: reuse `ABORTED`, which is already in the `processQueueEntry` demotion list with the
comment "Interrupted merge or downloading a part is not an error" → `LOG_INFO`, no stack trace.
Change only the exception code at the two CA retry-later throw sites in `DataPartsExchange.cpp`
(taxonomy row 3 and the `CaRelinkPromote::Unresolved` promote); the message text stays
self-describing. Verified: nothing on the fetch/queue path branches on `ABORTED` except the
demotion itself (shutdown-`ABORTED` overload is theoretical there). Also removes the misdirecting
`(NETWORK_ERROR)` label the issue complains about. Rejected: a dedicated new error code + a fourth
demotion branch (touches upstream, vetoed); `PART_IS_TEMPORARILY_LOCKED` (foreign semantics + a
`cleanup_thread.wakeup()` side effect); demoting all `NETWORK_ERROR` (hides real network faults).
Sender side already logs at `Debug` — receiver only.

## Nested `server_root_id` + prefix-based decommission victim selection (2031-triage CAS-007) {#nested-srid-decommission}

`validateServerRootId` accepts slashes (`Pool/CasServerRoot.h:199-229`; `gtest_cas_mount.cpp:97` asserts
`shard-01/replica-a` valid, and multi-segment srid support was deliberately fixed in `b97847d32f9`),
while `CasDecommission` picks victims by path prefix (`Tools/CasDecommission.cpp:146,150` +
prefix-LIST drains of `cas/manifests/<srid>/`, `staging/`, `roots/`). So
`SYSTEM CAS DROP POOL MEMBER 'a'` destroys the namespaces and control objects of a LIVE member
`a/b`. Existing test covers only the sibling case (`gtest_cas_decommission.cpp:699-716`). Partial
mitigation exists in one direction only: mounting `a` when `a/b` already exists fails closed
(`CasServerRoot.cpp:145-149`); the reverse order is unguarded. Note the asymmetry — relink routing
compares srid for EXACT equality (`ContentAddressedMetadataStorage.cpp:2021`), i.e. the prefix rule
is decommission-local.

Fix options (decide at fix time): (1) make decommission victim selection exact-srid + an explicit
refusal when any other member's srid is prefixed by the victim's, or (2) forbid nesting at validation
(reject a srid that is a prefix of, or prefixed by, an existing member's) — cheaper but removes the
multi-segment layouts that were deliberately enabled. Either way add the nesting case to
`gtest_cas_decommission.cpp`. P2: destructive but operator-initiated and requires a nested-srid
layout.

## Empty conditional token passes as an unconditional write on the Native backend (2031-triage CAS-010) {#empty-token-unconditional-write-guard}

`CasObjectStorageBackend`'s conditional-write path validates only the token TYPE
(`mintingTypeMatches`, `CasObjectStorageBackend.cpp:918-930`), and `Token::type` defaults to `ETag`
(`Primitives/CasTypes.h:259`), so a default-constructed `Token{}` passes every check; the S3 writer
then omits `If-Match` for an empty string (`WriteBufferFromS3.cpp:656-657,746-747`) and the "fenced"
write becomes an unconditional clobber. Emulated/InMemory backends fail closed, so the gap is
Native-only and invisible to the emu doubles.

No call site intentionally passes an empty expected token: callers either guard `head.exists` or use
`optional<Token>`. Generation-token paths additionally validate the numeric generation value, but an
empty ETag can still pass the type-only guard in `putOverwrite`, `casPut`, or `deleteExact`. The one
path that can legitimately produce an empty token on a `Done` write is `tokenFromWriteResult`'s
`HEAD` fallback, whose value flows into
`MountLeaseKeeper::last_token` (`CasServerRoot.cpp:1551,1688,1747,1828`); reaching it needs two
simultaneous store anomalies. Fix: reject an empty ETag token at the conditional-write entry
(fail-closed `LOGICAL_ERROR`-class throw) so no future call site can turn a fence into a clobber,
plus a Native-backend unit test. P2 — missing guard, not a demonstrated data-loss path.

## FIXED 2026-08-31 (S06 verified PASS 10/10; S21 fix landed, run not yet taken) `[s06-column-subset-verdict-measures-an-untouched-counter]` S06's column-subset check counts `CASBlobGet`, which the data read path never increments {#s06-column-subset-verdict-inert}

**Found by rerunning S06 at `--scale full` (2026-08-31) after `dev` and `ci` both left it
`INCONCLUSIVE`.** Scale is not the blocker, and no scale setting can be.

The verdict asks whether a few-column `SELECT` fetches far fewer blobs than an all-column scan, and
measures it as a `CASBlobGet` delta around each scan. At `full` — 10,000 columns, 2,000-row blocks —
both windows measured **zero**, so the card took its `all_gets == 0` branch and declared itself
inconclusive. It did the honest thing; the premise it needs was never established.

Zero is not explained by the reads being cheap or cached, because the run demonstrably moved data:
`CASBlobPut` 61,650, 60,078 objects and 300 MB in the pool. The discriminator is which code path
increments the counter, and the data read path is worth spelling out because it looks at first like
it could not possibly avoid the backend — a blob carries a fixed-length envelope, so its payload
cannot be read as if it started at byte zero.

It does not. `CasManifestReader::locate` returns a `BlobLocation` whose `offset` is the pool's
**fixed** `blob_header_len`, so no per-object header read is needed. `readBlobPayload` then calls
`object_storage->readObject` — the generic `IObjectStorage`, not `Cas::Backend` — and wraps the
result in a `ReadBufferFromFileView` starting at that offset. So the envelope IS skipped, by the
view's start offset rather than by a backend call, and `CasInstrumentedBackend` is nowhere on the
path. `checkOpAdmitted(CasOpClass::ContentRead)` is the only CAS-side gate on it, and it counts
nothing.

`CASBlobGet` is raised only in `CasInstrumentedBackend::get`, on the metadata/object path GC and the
ref machinery use; the sibling `CASBlobGetStream` is the backend's streaming get and is equally off
this path, which is why it too stayed at zero. The cumulative counters show the split directly:
`S3GetObject` 50,146 against `CASBlobGet` 14,509.

So the check is inert by construction, at `dev`, `ci` and `full` alike, and the two prior
`INCONCLUSIVE` verdicts carried no information about the property under test.

**Fix:** measure the delta the read path actually moves — `DiskS3GetObject` (or `S3GetObject`) —
and keep `CASBlobGet` only where a CAS backend get is genuinely expected. **Confirming experiment
before changing the verdict:** run the two scans unchanged and record both counters; the fix is
warranted only if `DiskS3GetObject` moves while `CASBlobGet` stays flat. If neither moves, the reads
are being served locally and the card needs a cache-drop, which is a different defect.

**The sweep is done, and it found one more.** Four cards touch `CASBlobGet`:

- **S06** (`s06_s08_manifest_parts.py`) — the verdict above.
- **S21** (`s19_s22_clone_fetch.py`) — `column-subset fetches only required blobs`, gated on
  `1-column CASBlobGet << all-column CASBlobGet`. **Same defect, same inert branch**, and it too has
  been `INCONCLUSIVE` at every scale it has been run at. Fix both together.
- **S12/S14** (`s12_s14_faults.py`) — reads the counter into observations, but its verdict is about
  `CASRootList`/`CASRootGet` at startup, which genuinely do traverse the CAS backend. Correct as is.
- **S41** (`s41_wide_insert_baseline.py`) — observations only, and its own docstring states that
  "`CASBlobGet` is a metadata GET here". That is independent corroboration of the discriminator:
  the counter's metadata scope was already understood and written down in this tree, which is what
  makes S06's and S21's use of it to measure column-data reads wrong rather than merely unlucky.

## `[s23-idle-rss-growth-500mb]` 500 MB of RSS growth on an empty, idle pool over 15 minutes {#s23-idle-rss-growth}

**Found by rerunning S23 at `--scale full` (2026-08-31), which FAILED where `dev` and `ci` were
inconclusive.** The `dev` window is 4 minutes at 5 s per minute; `full` is 15 real minutes, and that
is what made the verdict discriminate.

`memory flat over idle window` failed with `idle_rss_growth` = **500,146,176 bytes**. Per node,
resident went 677 MB to 1,178 MB on `ch1` and 641 MB to 1,087 MB on `ch2`. It is not only allocator
noise: ClickHouse's own `mem_tracking` roughly doubled too, 337 MB to 666 MB.

What makes it worth a look is what the pool held while this happened: **nothing**. `pool_shape` is
zero across every class — no blobs, no manifests, no refs, no roots, no files — `leftover_ca_tables`
is empty, `max_s3_ops_per_round` is 0, and GC deleted nothing across 11 successful rounds.

**Not yet established as a leak, and the reason is the window.** Fifteen minutes cannot separate a
server settling into its steady state — thread pools, caches and arenas materializing after boot —
from growth that does not stop. Peak resident (1,158 MB) sits close to final (1,181 MB), which is
weak evidence for a plateau.

**There is no `trace_log` evidence for this, and three separate things must change before a rerun
can produce any.** Asked whether the trace told us where the 500 MB went, the answer is no:

1. **The artifact dump does not collect it.** `predown_dump.sh` loops `for tt in CPU Real` — the
   `Memory` trace type is never queried, so no allocation stacks reach the run directory.
2. **There would be nothing to collect.** `total_memory_profiler_step` — the server-level knob that
   samples background and idle allocations — defaults to **0**, meaning off, and `ca-soak`'s
   `profiling.xml` sets only the two query profilers. The per-query `memory_profiler_step` (4 MiB)
   cannot fire during an idle window because no query is running. This is why the earlier one-hour
   chaos soak did have ~25k `Memory` samples while an idle run would have none: those came from
   queries.
3. **What was collected is not time-scoped — but the capability exists and is simply unused.**
   `predown_dump.sh` already accepts `FROM_TS`/`TO_TS` and folds them into a `${WINDOW}` clause on
   every trace query; the scenario runner just never passes them. So S23's `Real` aggregate spans the
   whole server lifetime, and although it is full of CAS write frames — `commit` 380 samples,
   `publishStaging` 378, `publishBlob` 365, `fanOutBlobUploads` 368, and
   `CityHash128BlobHashingWriteBuffer::nextImpl` 172 — those most plausibly belong to the setup phase
   and cannot be attributed to the idle minutes either way. The pool was empty by the end. Fixing
   this is a matter of the card passing the window it already knows, not of adding a feature.

**Items 1 and 2 are now fixed and verified (2026-08-31).** `predown_dump.sh` dumps `Memory` alongside
`CPU` and `Real`, and `configs/memory.xml` sets `total_memory_profiler_step` to 4 MiB. The setting
had to go in `memory.xml` rather than `profiling.xml`, because the latter is mounted into `users.d`
where a server setting is ignored. Verified on a live cluster: the setting reports `changed = 1`, a
write workload produced **1,064 background** `Memory` samples where the count would previously have
been zero, and the dump wrote 1.27 MB of `Memory` stacks with no error output.

**Experiment that decides it,** with those three fixed first: set `total_memory_profiler_step` to a
few MiB on the server, have the dump query the `Memory` trace type, and scope the aggregate to the
idle window by `event_time`. Then run one idle scenario with a 60-plus-minute window, sampling RSS
and `mem_tracking` each minute, and read the shape of the curve rather than its endpoints. A plateau
means the verdict's threshold is wrong for a freshly booted server; continued linear growth on an
empty pool means a leak, and the `Memory` stacks will say whose. Do not file a leak against the
product on the 15-minute number alone.

## `[s10-patch-premise-blocked-by-a-hardcoded-workaround]` S10 forces the non-patch delete path, so its patch-part premise cannot hold {#s10-patch-premise-blocked}

**Supersedes an earlier entry of mine that named the wrong cause.** I first attributed
`max_patch_parts_observed = 0` to `apply_patches_on_merge` being set at session level. That setting
defect is real, but it is not why patch parts are absent.

The actual cause is one line: `lw_supported = False` is **hardcoded** in S10, so the `if
lw_supported:` branch never fires and the lightweight `DELETE FROM` beneath it is dead code. The card
falls through to `ALTER TABLE ... DELETE`, which produces mutations, not patch parts. No setting and
no scale can produce a patch part while that line stands.

**The claim justifying that line is stale, and there is no product defect. Tested 2026-08-31.**
The comment says lightweight `DELETE` is "unreliable on this build (CA storage path diverges)". It was
added 2026-07-01 in the commit that introduced the whole suite (`b3fa29f29266`), whose message never
mentions lightweight `DELETE` — so the assertion stood for two months with no recorded error text, no
issue and no reproduction behind it.

Measured directly against a CA-disk table with a row-count-and-checksum oracle: 50,000 rows, two
`DELETE FROM ... WHERE bucket = N` statements, expected survivors 40,000 with checksum
1441566520450331260. Result: **40,000 rows and exactly that checksum**, no error. Lightweight `DELETE`
is correct on the CA path.

**But removing the flag would still not produce a patch part, and that is the more useful finding.**
Lightweight `DELETE` creates none: the run left 0 patch parts and one `Wide` part. Patch parts come
from lightweight **UPDATE**, and reaching them needs three table settings, each of which the server
names in an error until supplied:

| requirement | how it announces itself |
|---|---|
| `enable_block_number_column = 1` | `Code: 48 ... supported only for tables with materialized _block_number column` |
| `enable_block_offset_column = 1` | the same error, now naming `_block_offset` |
| `apply_patches_on_merge = 1` | a **table** setting; the session `SET` S10 uses throws `Code: 115` |

With all three plus `allow_experimental_lightweight_update`, an `UPDATE ... WHERE bucket = 5` on a CA
table succeeds and yields `patch-c46b00d08453527290352a2e6e9ad36f-all_3_3_0_2`, 2,000 rows, oracle
matching exactly (2,000 patched of 20,000).

**S10's detector is already correct** and needs no change: it matches `part_type = 'Patch' OR name
LIKE 'patch-%'`, and the real part carries that prefix.

**One caution before removing the flag.** Its comment gives two reasons and only the first is refuted.
"Unreliable" is false; "force the ALTER TABLE DELETE fallback for correct oracle semantics" is a
separate claim about how the card counts rows. The oracle used here counts through `SELECT`, which
honours the delete mask — but S10's own oracle must be checked against masked rows before its delete
path is switched, not assumed equivalent.

**Secondary, and worth fixing regardless:** `_probe_patch_parts` issues `SET apply_patches_on_merge
= 1`, which throws `Code: 115` because the name is a **MergeTree table setting**
(`MergeTreeSettings.cpp:861`), not a session one. The probe then returns `True` anyway, because
`allow_experimental_lightweight_update` was accepted and any single acceptance satisfies it. So the
probe reports patch support on the strength of a setting that does not by itself produce patch parts,
and swallows the one genuine rejection into an observation. Apply it with `ALTER TABLE ... MODIFY
SETTING` or at `CREATE`, and make the probe require the setting that actually matters rather than any
of them.

## `[s10-one-unreachable-manifest-survives-gc-fixpoint]` A single unreachable manifest survives GC to fixpoint, three rounds running {#s10-manifest-residual}

**Found at `--scale full` (2026-08-31); the same run as the entry above, so read that first — the
patch-part premise did not hold, and this residual arises from the lightweight-delete workload
rather than from patch content.**

`no unbounded leftovers` and `obsolete patch content reclaimed` both failed on one object:
`fsck_final` reports `unreachable: 1, dangling: 0` against `reachable: 163`, and
`residual_classification` puts it in `leak` as `unreachable:_manifests: 1` — not `pipeline`, not
`bookkeeping`. `reclaimable_drain_check` agrees it is reclaimable. `gc_fixpoint_history` is
`[1, 1, 1]`: GC was driven to fixpoint three times and the residual did not move.

One object is small but the shape is not benign — a reclaimable, unreachable manifest that survives
repeated fixpoints is by definition not being reclaimed. Also worth a glance in the same run:
`graduation_drain_history` is a run of ones with a single **128** in it.

**Before calling it a product defect:** identify the object and what still points at it, and
re-derive whether the workload can legitimately leave it (a manifest published after the fold's
coverage seal is bookkeeping, not a leak). The classification is the card's, and the card's premise
was broken in the same run.

## `[ca-event-log-loses-gc-manifest-deletes]` GC deleted 517 manifests and the CA event log recorded one {#ca-event-log-loses-manifest-deletes}

**Found while auditing S10's leftover-manifest finding in `cas_log` (2026-08-31).** This is why that
audit could not be done.

In the full-scale S10 run, `ch1`'s `gc_log` sums to exactly **517** `manifests_deleted` across its
rounds — round 6 alone deletes 133 — while `ch1`'s `cas_log` holds exactly **one**
`manifest_delete` event. `ch2` deleted none and logged none, so the whole discrepancy sits on one
node.

It is not a semantics mismatch between the two numbers. `CasGc.cpp` PHASE 15/18 emits
`CasEventType::ManifestDelete` **unconditionally, once per attempt**, inside the `mf_cleanup_now`
loop, and increments `report.manifests_deleted` only when the outcome classifies as `Deleted`. So
attempts are greater than or equal to deletions, and the event count must be **at least** 517.
It is 1.

One event did land — round 1, for a namespace owned by the other server root — so the emitter is
wired and reachable. That argues for events being dropped or lost rather than never produced.
Candidates not yet distinguished: a bounded queue in the event sink discarding under burst (round 6's
133 deletions in one phase is exactly a burst), a per-call `EventEmitter{*store}` binding to a sink
that is not the disk's configured log on most calls, or rows buffered in `ca_event_log` and lost when
the scenario tears the cluster down.

**Consequence for anything that reads `cas_log`:** manifest reclaim is effectively invisible there,
so `cas_log` cannot support any claim about whether a manifest was deleted, retried or skipped. The
S10 residual finding must be re-derived from `gc_log` and `fsck` until this is fixed.

**First step:** count events against `attempted` rather than against `manifests_deleted` — the phase
already records `attempted` as a metric — and check whether `system.ca_event_log` shows drops of its
own before looking for a bug in the emitter.

## `[s15-month-name-timestamp]` FIXED: S15 failed every variant on a format specifier {#s15-month-name-timestamp}

**Diagnosed and fixed 2026-08-31.** S15 had been `INCONCLUSIVE` at every scale, and the cause was
neither scale, nor shard counts, nor measurement. All three of its compose variants ran; all three
raised.

The verdict `variant <name> workload` is declared inconclusive when `_run_variant` throws, and the
throw was `Code: 41 ... while converting '2026-08-31 07:August:34' to DateTime`. The minutes field
holds `August`, because the card built its since-timestamp with
`formatDateTime(now(),'%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')` and in ClickHouse **`%M` is the month name** — minutes
are `%i`. Every later query scoped by that timestamp then threw, taking the whole variant with it, so
five of eight verdicts could never resolve.

Fixed by using `toString(now())`, which yields the canonical form directly, at both call sites.

**The part worth remembering is that this trap was already documented in this very tree.**
`scenarios/run.py` carries a helper whose comment reads: "Do NOT use `formatDateTime` with `'%M'` —
in ClickHouse `'%M'` is the MONTH NAME, not minutes, which silently corrupts the since-timestamp used
to scope every card's GC/event-log queries." The card fell into it anyway, twice. A warning in a
comment beside the correct helper did not stop a second implementation of the wrong thing; only a
grep for `formatDateTime` with `%M` across the tree would have, and that sweep now finds exactly
these two sites and nothing else. The other `%M` hits in `utils/ca-soak` are Python `strftime` and
shell `date`, where `%M` genuinely means minutes.

**Also worth noting for anyone reading a report:** the exception text was never hidden — it sat in
the verdict's `note` field all along. I first read `detail`/`evidence`, found them empty, and
concluded the verdicts carried no reason. The `Verdict` record's fields are `name`, `expected`,
`observed`, `note`. Read `note`.

## `[s23-idle-baseline-measures-the-telemetry]` An idle CAS pool's background allocator is system-log flushing, not CAS {#s23-idle-baseline-measures-telemetry}

**Measured 2026-08-31, using the `Memory` trace collection enabled the same day.** Fifteen idle
minutes on an empty pool, all tables dropped, the trace aggregate scoped to the window itself.

**RSS did not accumulate:** +19 MB drift inside an oscillation of roughly plus or minus 80 MB
(1,033 to 1,193 MB). **No CAS frame appears in the background allocation top at all.** What does
appear is an INSERT — `MergeTreeSink::consume` into `MergeTreeDataWriter::writeTempPart`, 1,705
samples — and `system.part_log` names the destinations: about 1,055 inserts across eight system log
tables in fifteen minutes, `metric_log` alone accounting for 43.98 MiB, `trace_log` for 88,215 rows.
An idle server is busy writing telemetry about itself, and part of that is self-inflicted: the 10 ms
query profiler in `configs/profiling.xml` plus the memory sampling produce the very `trace_log` rows
whose flush then allocates.

**This reframes S23's verdict rather than settling it.** A verdict named "memory flat over idle
window" is, at this profiling configuration, mostly measuring the cost of observing the server —
roughly 176 MB/hour of system-log data before any CAS work exists. Either the threshold accounts for
that churn, or the scenario quiets the profiler for the duration of the idle measurement. Measuring
CAS's idle cost through an amplified telemetry path measures the wrong thing.

**What this probe does NOT establish, and the reason is that it is not S23's experiment.** It began
at 1,102 MB, which is where S23 *ended* (1,178 MB), because a write workload had run before the
tables were dropped. S23 began at 677 MB on a freshly booted server and climbed. So the two runs
converge on the same plateau by different routes, and the plateau is stable — but that the climb from
677 MB stops there is plausible, not shown. A fresh boot idled for 60-plus minutes, read as a curve,
is what would show it. Until then nothing here may be recorded as a leak, and nothing may be recorded
as warm-up either.

## `[soak-retry-budget-turns-a-503-into-a-livelock]` A 500-attempt retry budget converts RustFS's read-concurrency limit into an indefinite stall {#soak-retry-budget-livelock}

**Observed live 2026-08-31 while verifying an S21 fix; the merge sat at progress 0.11 having read
20.67 MiB of 1.10 GiB, and advanced 0 bytes in 40 seconds.** Every link below is measured or quoted,
because two earlier explanations of mine were not.

- RustFS says exactly what is wrong, 3,884 times in twelve minutes:
  `SlowDown: disk read concurrency limit reached, please reduce your request rate`. It is a
  **concurrency** ceiling, not a volume problem — the store answers a direct probe in 1.2 ms while
  refusing the merge's reads.
- The client does not pace itself: `s3_max_get_rps` and `s3_max_get_burst` are both **0**.
- The retry budget is **500** (`s3_retry_attempts`), and the log shows `Attempt 19/501`.

So a persistent 503 becomes neither success nor failure. Every thread keeps retrying, concurrency
therefore never falls back under the ceiling, and the operation cannot finish or give up. 104 threads
were parked in `RetryRequestSleep` at once.

**The failure mode is already named in this repo, for a different trigger.** `configs/storage_conf.xml`
carries a B187 comment describing "the 500x5s retry storm that wedges the merge finalize", caused by
rustfs closing mid-body on a conditional PUT, and mitigates *that* path with
`expect_continue_min_bytes = 65536`. The read path has no equivalent mitigation, so the same wedge
returns through the concurrency limit. **Two workarounds interacting: a retry budget raised to survive
one rustfs defect turns a second rustfs behaviour into a livelock.**

**Fix, in the order the evidence supports it.** Set `s3_max_get_rps` so the client stays under the
store's ceiling — this is precisely what the error message asks for, and it is a rig configuration
gap, not a product defect. Then reconsider whether 500 attempts is right: a budget that large cannot
distinguish "retry until the transient clears" from "wait forever", and a persistent, self-caused 503
deserves to surface as an error long before attempt 500. Both are wider than S21 — every scenario
doing concurrent reads at scale is exposed.

**The ceiling IS configurable, and raising it fixes the stall.** `RUSTFS_OBJECT_MAX_CONCURRENT_DISK_READS`
is the knob — found by extracting `RUSTFS_*` names from the `1.0.0-rc.3` binary, alongside
`RUSTFS_OBJECT_DISK_PERMIT_WAIT_TIMEOUT`, `RUSTFS_OBJECT_DISK_DEGRADED_READ_CAP`,
`RUSTFS_OBJECT_DISK_READ_TIMEOUT` and `RUSTFS_OBJECT_DISK_WRITE_ABSOLUTE_CAP`. The binary also carries
the write-side twin of the message, `foreground write concurrency limit reached`.

Measured, not assumed:

| ceiling | outcome for the same 1.1 GiB seven-part merge |
|---|---|
| default | never completes: 20 MiB read, 0 bytes written across a 40 s window, 3,884 503s in 12 min |
| **256** | **completes**: `system.part_log` shows `MergeParts` at 1,211.7 s with `error = 0` |

`configs/rustfs.env` is set to 256 for that reason. A trial at 1024 was botched — rustfs was restarted
mid-merge, destroying the experiment — so 1024 carries no evidence and is not used.

**Two things this does not settle.** 503s still occur at 256 (579 in three minutes) while the host is
completely idle: load 0.82, iowait 0%, on NVMe. So the ceiling is reached for reasons other than
physical disk saturation, and what those are is unknown. And the client still does not pace itself at
all, so every refusal becomes a long wait rather than an error — `s3_max_get_rps` remains the other
half of the fix.

**A hypothesis I raised and then withdrew, recorded so nobody re-runs it:** I proposed a permit leak in
rustfs, on the grounds that progress came in a burst after each restart and then appeared to stop.
The merge's completion refutes it. What actually happened is that the merge was slow and *uneven*, and
I sampled a single 90-second window that fell in a pause, then concluded throughput was zero. Read a
curve, not one interval.

## `[renewal-gives-up-with-budget-left]` A renewal stopped with 1,969 ms of confirmed budget unspent, and one attempt burned 23.7 s {#renewal-gives-up-with-budget-left}

**Supersedes an earlier framing of mine that reported known, fixed behaviour as a new defect.** The
first version of this entry said "a single unresolved heartbeat write costs the mount lease, with no
retry" — which is exactly what
[Issue #2244](https://github.com/Altinity/ClickHouse/issues/2244) diagnosed on 2026-08-20 and whose
minimum fix landed **2026-08-24** (`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-23-cas-mount-renewal-retry-design.md`),
with focused and full TLA+, Release/Debug, proxy-integration and 15-minute S39 gates. Filing it again
as novel was a duplicate.

**Observed 2026-09-01, S03 at `--scale full`**, which then failed with `Code: 210 ... mount lease not
held`. Read off `system.ca_event_log`:

| field | ch1 | ch2 |
|---|---|---|
| `attempts_sent` | 1 | **1** |
| `elapsed_ms` | **23,755** | 18,031 |
| `remaining_confirmed_budget_ms` | 0 | **1,969** |
| `unresolved_reason` | `deadline_mid_way` | `deadline_mid_way` |
| `classification` | `external_lease_deadline` | `external_lease_deadline` |
| `stop_cause` | `continue` | `continue` |

**What is NOT a defect, on the current design.** The implemented protocol retries "within the time
still justified by its last confirmed lease". ch1 had **zero** budget left, so sending no second
attempt is the design working, not failing.

**What is worth investigating, and both are separate from #2244's original diagnosis.**

**ch2 stopped with 1,969 ms of confirmed budget remaining** and `stop_cause = continue`, meaning
nothing asked it to stop — precisely the window in which the 2026-08-24 fix is supposed to retry.
Either the budget arithmetic, the margin term (`now + margin < confirmed_deadline`), or the loop's
exit condition keeps a retry from being issued when one is still justified.

**A single attempt consumed 23.7 s against a 30 s TTL.** #2244 describes renewal as "one
5-second-timeout `PUT` per 10-second period". An attempt running 23.7 s is nearly five times that
bound, so either the per-attempt timeout is not being applied on this path or the attempt is not the
`PUT` alone. Whatever the answer, an attempt that can eat 79% of the TTL leaves no room for the retry
protocol to help — the budget is gone before the second attempt could be considered.

**Why the write did not resolve** is the storage saturation measured the same night: RustFS reporting
`permits_in_use: 256/256`, 100% queue utilization, answering `503` after ~5 s with its CPU at 0.13%.
A heartbeat is an ordinary write on that path and gets no privilege.

**Downstream, and correct.** The fenced epoch is terminal, so the self-remount re-claims with a fresh
`writer_epoch`, finds the previous epoch's slot un-fenced and not proven dead, and refuses under "no
wall-clock trust" — three `mount_conflict` events with `outcome = live_double_start`, five seconds
apart. That refusal prevents taking a lease from a possibly-live writer on a clock guess. Do not read
those conflicts as the fault. Related: `[issue-2244-remount-retry-follow-up]`, the still-open per-step
remount work.

**Reproduction:** S03 at `--scale full`; does not reproduce at `dev` or `ci`. The ten-second span of
the conflicts is an artifact of when `predown_dump` ran, not the duration of the event.
## `[s05-standalone-repoints-on-the-non-transactional-path]` 1,200 committed refs repointed outside a transaction during sparse-write GC {#s05-standalone-repoints}

**Found 2026-09-01, S05 at `--scale full`** (10,000 tables, one insert each). Sixteen verdicts, zero
anomalies — the card ran cleanly and caught product behaviour, not a harness fault.

`CASRefRepoint == 0 on the non-transactional path` observed **1,200**. The card's own note: "unexpected
standalone repoint of a committed ref during sparse-write GC — investigate which op took the
`repointRef` path".

It does NOT reproduce at `dev` or `ci`, so whatever takes that path needs either the object count or
the sparse-write shape that only `full` produces.

**First question to answer:** which operation calls `repointRef` outside a transaction. The count is
suspiciously close to a per-table figure for a 10,000-table pool, so start by checking whether it
scales with tables, with parts, or with GC rounds. Related: `[part-removal-repoint-waste]`, where
`delete_tmp_*` repoints were measured at ~22% of the writer PUT class — if the same call site is
responsible, these are one finding, not two.

## `[s01-rss-growth-scales-with-the-blob]` RSS growth during a large upload is a fraction of the blob, not a constant {#s01-rss-scales}

**Measured 2026-09-01 across two scales of S01.** At `ci` (512 MiB blob) RSS growth during the upload
was **exactly 0**. At `full` (8 GiB blob) it was **2.228 GiB — 28% of the blob**. Growth tracks the
blob rather than staying flat, so it is not query-pipeline noise.

The verdict passes either way, because its threshold is "growth < blob size" — which would admit 99%
just as happily. It catches full materialization and nothing short of it.

**Where the memory actually goes, from `Memory` trace samples taken over the same run:** 42% in
`SerializationString::deserializeBinaryBulkWithSizeStream` under `MergeTreeReaderWide::readData`, 6%
in `ColumnString::shrinkToFit` under `MergeTreeSequentialSource::generate` inside `MergeTask` — that
is the MERGE reading String columns. Only **7%** falls in the CAS write path (`publishBlob`,
`PartWriteTxn`). So the card's headline verdict, which exists to prove the write path streams,
is dominated by the read side of the merge that builds the part.

**Two things to settle before tightening anything.** Whether the 28% is buffering by design or the
same effect Altinity#2233 reports (RSS growing 0.98 GiB on a 0.50 GiB blob, i.e. ABOVE the blob) —
measuring growth at three blob sizes answers it. And whether the verdict should measure the write path
specifically rather than whole-server RSS, which is a different verdict and needs its own design.

**Caveat on the trace evidence:** 139 samples, with 43% landing in generic thread-pool frames that were
not decomposed. Enough to show where the bulk sits, not enough to apportion precisely.

## `[manifest-cache-by-id-prose-batch]` manifest-cache-by-id: prose and naming batch {#manifest-cache-by-id-prose-batch}

Found by the final whole-branch review of the manifest-cache-by-id work (branch `cas-gc-rebuild`,

  (`unlinkFile`'s `already_proven` memo) and
  `src/Disks/DiskObjectStorage/MetadataStorages/ContentAddressed/ContentAddressedTransaction.h:166`
  (`force_fresh_validated_refs`). The surrounding comments were rewritten from "re-proven" to
  "resolved" while the identifiers still say proven/validated — the memo now saves a fresh RESOLVE, not
  a proof. Rename `force_fresh_validated_refs` to `force_fresh_resolved_refs` and `already_proven` to
  `already_resolved` (or fold into the memo's removal, if that happens first).

## `[cas-unit-test-mutation-battery]` Proposed: a dynamic mutation battery over the CAS unit tests (2026-09-03, deferred by the user) {#cas-unit-test-mutation-battery}

**Context.** The backend request-contract migration (spec
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-02-cas-backend-token-contract-design.md`, revision 13) rewrote most of
the 142 CAS unit-test files: doubles moved from the legacy verbs to `CasRequests`, one-shot faults were
re-modelled for an engine that retries, counts pinned to the old controller were re-derived. The user
asked whether the tests still test something useful or degenerated into `2 + 2 = 4`. The static half of
that audit (two reviewers, per-test "killing mutation" + verdict DISCRIMINATING / WEAK / TAUTOLOGICAL)
is recorded in `docs/superpowers/cas/2026-09-03-test-vacuity-audit.md`; its ranked mutant lists are the
input to this item. The dynamic half was NOT run — other priorities (user, 2026-09-03).

**Proposal (dynamic half).** Execute the mutants: a mutant nobody kills is a hole in the suite.

1. Merge the auditors' mutant lists into at most 20 distinct one-line production mutants (never a test
   line); one patch file each, with the tests the audit expects to go red.
2. Per mutant, in order: apply → `ninja unit_tests_dbms` in `build_debug` → run
   `build_debug/src/unit_tests_dbms --gtest_filter='CAS*'` (the gate filter is exactly `CAS*`) → record
   ran / passed / failed and the FAILED names → revert and verify `git status --porcelain -- src` is
   empty before the next mutant.
3. Verdict per mutant: KILLED (an expected test is red), KILLED-BY-OTHERS (red, but none of the expected
   tests — name what killed it), SURVIVED (zero reds: name the property no test pins). An abort in the
   debug build counts as killed by an assertion; say so.
4. Commit nothing from the mutants; finish with one clean `CAS*` gate to prove the tree is restored.
5. Output: the mutant table (patch, expected tests, actual reds, verdict), the SURVIVED list with the
   property each exposes, and for every test the static audit called TAUTOLOGICAL or WEAK whether the
   battery confirms or refutes it. Each SURVIVED mutant becomes a test to write, not a note.

**Cost.** ~20 incremental debug builds + ~20 `CAS*` runs, sequential (one builder); roughly 3–4 hours
of a cheap agent's time. Zero risk to the tree if step 2's revert check is honoured.
