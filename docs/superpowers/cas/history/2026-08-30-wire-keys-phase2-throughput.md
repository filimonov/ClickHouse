Both sides built with the same compiler and flags (`clang-21`, `SANITIZE=OFF`, `ENABLE_BENCHMARKS=ON`)
and run back to back on one machine.

**Read the repetition medians as the result; read the 21-row single run as breadth.** The two sides of
the single run were NOT taken under comparable load: the 1-minute load average was 16.09 while the
BEFORE side ran and 3.04 while the AFTER side did. A loaded BEFORE side measures slower, so that run
understates the regression rather than inventing one — but it is not a fair pair. The repetition runs
were quiet and matched (0.64 and 0.92) and are the numbers to quote. `cpu_scaling_enabled` was true
throughout, which is another reason to trust relative medians over absolute nanoseconds.

- BEFORE: worktree at `65ec8688cdb` (the commit preceding phase-2 Task 1), `contrib` shared with the
  main checkout — verified identical, `git diff --submodule 65ec8688cdb..HEAD -- contrib` is empty.
- AFTER: `dbd7ed65635` (phase-2 complete bar the final gate).
- Harness: `benchmark_cas_ref_protocol`. Raw JSON in `bench-wire-keys-phase2/`
  (`before.json` / `after.json`, and the `--benchmark_repetitions=3` pair `before_rep.json` /
  `after_rep.json`).

The in-file baseline table at the top of `benchmark_cas_ref_protocol.cpp` predates this design and is
NOT the before side.

## Reading {#reading}

Every measured path costs single-digit percent more, with no outlier and nothing multiplicative. The
medians and the single run agree on the shape and on every headline figure, but not to a fixed
tolerance: the gaps are 1.50, 0.67, 0.67, 4.23 and 2.61 points, and the two `BM_SnapshotEncode` sizes
swap which of them is worse between the two runs. Neither run resolves differences of a point or two
between sizes; both resolve the conclusion.

The largest consistent cost is on DECODE (`BM_ReplayHistory`, the fold/recovery profile: +6.9% to
+8.8%), which is where the design said the primary evidence would be — the dominant risk was always
the longer keys themselves, paid in bytes written, compressed, decompressed and compared. Encode
follows at +5% to +7.5%. `BM_ApplyRefLogTxn` and `BM_FlushInstallUniqueOwner` straddle zero, which is
what a path dominated by work other than key handling should do; the −9.8% outlier there is noise, not
a speedup.

## What this does NOT cover {#what-this-does-not-cover}

The harness measures `cas_ref_log` and `RefSnapshot` only. `PartManifest`, `FoldSeal`, `RefCatalog`
and raw `cas_run` streaming have no throughput coverage — the design says to reach them by EXTENDING
this harness rather than adding a second one, and that work belongs to phase 3 along with the
stored-versus-decompressed byte accounting and the hot-path assembly review.
