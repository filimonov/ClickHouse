# CAS Backlog — Google Cloud Storage {#gcs}

Part of the [CAS live backlog](/superpowers/cas/backlog). Topic file for everything that is specific to
running CAS on GCS: the live release gate, the two GCS-only failure classes found on 2026-09-02, the
environment findings of the same day, and the fix options with their trade-offs. The run record with
timestamps and evidence paths is the
[2026-09-02 live validation ledger](/superpowers/cas/gcs-live-validation-ledger-2026-09-02); this file
carries the decisions, so nothing in the ledger has to be re-derived.

## What holds on GCS today {#what-holds}

Proved on the real bucket with the `gcs_hmac` client, binary of 2026-09-02:

- The live gate `tests/integration/test_gcs_live`: 13 passed, 0 failed in four consecutive runs.
  Google accepts every ordinary and CAS request shape, including batch `DeleteObjects` (no singular
  fallback), multipart, native staged copy, the condemned-staged retag; every incarnation token is a
  numeric generation.
- Two replicas over one pool survive a ten-minute storm of connect timeouts to Google with zero
  failed `INSERT`/`SELECT` and both mount leases held (renewal retried and recovered).
- The mount refuses a bucket verified as versioned and proceeds with a warning when it cannot read
  the versioning configuration (`bd4cfc8d76f`); soft delete remains an operator precondition.

## Release gate: what is still unrun {#gate}

- **[gcs-live-gate-oauth-and-ambiguity] the `gcp_oauth` groups and the TLS ambiguity arms have never
  executed against Google** — GATE — 10 `gcp_oauth` cases need an ADC triple
  (`google_adc_client_id/secret/refresh_token` from `gcloud auth application-default login`) or a GCE
  host; 4 ambiguity cases need the TLS-terminating fault driver with the control contract documented
  in the [live-results gate](/superpowers/cas/unconditional-blob-publication-live-results). The driver
  does not exist; `utils/ca-soak/proxy/s3_fault_proxy.py` is plain HTTP and cannot sit in front of
  `storage.googleapis.com` without switching `deduceProviderType` off. Also still open from the older
  follow-ups: the ordinary `test_storage_s3` lane once its historical image resolves,
  generation-aware LIST discovery (re-listing is cost-only today), signed `x-goog-*` `extra_headers`
  for `gcs_hmac`. Decision needed: build the driver (days) or descope the four arms in the gate
  document with a stated reason.

## Failure class 1: relink-confirm liveness (F11) {#relink-confirm-lane-livelock}

- **[relink-confirm-lane-livelock] two replicas starve each other's fetch-by-relink confirms** — HARD /
  RELEASE GATE (data divergence, not data loss). IMPLEMENTED, REVIEWED, LIVE GATE RUN AND OPEN
  (2026-09-03): the ten-minute phase-3 soak ran on the real GCS stand and the fix passed every direct
  measurement, but the run did not pass the gate as specified and the item stays open on two
  harness-side blockers, F13 and F14 in the live ledger. What the run established, on the real bucket:
  230 fetch-by-relink confirms across the two replicas all answered yes, with zero occurrences of
  `Relink confirm is unproven` — which the answering peer logs for every non-`Yes` answer, including
  the arms that refuse without incrementing a counter — zero `NO_REPLICA_HAS_PART`, both replication
  queues empty at the end, and no divergence at any checkpoint. The same stand on the pre-fix binary had
  answered unproven 2999 times in two hours. The refusal criterion is therefore met on the stronger
  reading: no confirm was refused for any reason, rather than one refusal class merely dominating the
  others.
  Read the exercise as four minutes, not as the run. All 230 relinks fall inside a four-minute burst,
  the only stretch of a two-hour-ten-minute run where the workload ran; there is no relink on either
  node in the remaining two hours and six minutes. That burst is when a lane is busy, which is the
  condition the fix narrows, and it ran under real provider back-pressure.
  Why it is not closed: the soak exited non-zero on a checkpoint leak assert that fires on the pool
  prefix's inherited debris rather than on anything the run did (F13), and a checkpoint longer than the
  whole timeline consumed the chaos window, so one of four scheduled faults fired and the fence-losing
  freeze never ran (F14). No refusal path fired live, so the increment-to-`system.events` step is still
  unproven for all five counters, though all five are registered under their names on both servers. A
  re-run against a fresh pool prefix removes both blockers and is what would close this.
  A third finding, F15, sits underneath F13 and F14 and explains the checkpoint cost both describe: a
  single fold round holds the GC lease for hours on this bucket, so a stage that waits for a collection
  fixpoint cannot converge inside a ten-minute soak. It is pre-existing and unrelated to the relink
  change; the peer's rounds no-op cleanly as `NotALeader` throughout.
  Gate report: `.superpowers/sdd/2026-09-02-cas-relink-confirm-liveness/task-8-report.md`.
  Design: [relink confirm liveness design](/superpowers/specs/cas-relink-confirm-liveness-design),
  revision 10 (rule 3 refuses while a queued or in-flight mutation names the queried ref, read from
  the `MutationScope` every lane item already carries; `Wedged` and broken lanes refuse table-wide).
  Plan: [implementation plan](/superpowers/plans/cas-relink-confirm-liveness); commits: `1d0be22d4cd`,
  `0ccdf5a8f53`, `12e81e7871c`, `b51b72cf7ea`, `89a60b1b7f8`, `10d571917c7`, `9c18abd0a70`,
  `347351bbcd8`, `3041e79068e`, `70f2ce78bed`, `b0b980ac8d9`, `a43e2ef89d3`, `bf44441fe61`,
  `f4c87d0a6d8`.

**What happened.** After the connect storm both replication queues wedged with
`NO_REPLICA_HAS_PART: Source ... did not prove it still holds the manifest it offered ... by relink`;
the source answered `Relink confirm is unproven (unknown)` about 4.5k times per ten minutes per node
for forty minutes after the network recovered; replicas diverged to 123k vs 166k rows; the soak died on
`SYSTEM SYNC REPLICA`. 27,647 `build_abort abandoned` events in that window, each a precommit-removal
appended to the receiver's own lane and debris left for GC.

**Mechanism (confirmed by experiment).** `CasRefLedger::confirmExactRef` rule 3 answers `Unknown`
whenever the source namespace's ref lane has any pending append or an active leader tenure
(`rt.lane_state != Ready || !rt.pending.empty() || rt.leader_active`). Every replica is also a receiver;
each failing fetch costs it a precommit at T1 and a precommit-removal at abort, both appends to its own
lane; merges, mutations and inserts append too. On GCS a tenure is long because every flush ends with a
token-CAS on `_ckpt` that hits the one-mutation-per-second object limit and backs off. So neither side
ever sees the other's lane quiescent. `SYSTEM STOP FETCHES` on one replica made it answer zero
`Unknown` and let the other drain 1701 → 48 in two minutes; with fetches still stopped but 13 merges
running the same replica answered `Unknown` to 891 of 898 confirms. On RustFS in a LAN tenures are
milliseconds and quiescent gaps are common, which is why no soak saw this before.

**Why rule 3 cannot simply go.** The TLA+ model `docs/superpowers/models/CaRelinkConfirmCore.tla`
(`SabotageStaleCache`) shows the counterexample: the leader has made a transaction carrying a removal
durable but not yet applied it to the in-memory row (the leader holds `state_mutex` only for copy-out
and apply-after-commit, not for the `PUT`); a confirm in that gap reads the stale row, answers `Yes`,
the receiver promotes over blobs whose only protection is already durably gone, and GC can reclaim
them. The hazard is exactly the interval "durable, not yet applied". A `pending` item not yet carved
and a `PUT` still in flight are not durable and do not break the T1 < T2 argument; today's rule
refuses far more than the argument requires.

**Decision (2026-09-02, spec revision 8).** Rule 3 refuses while a queued or in-flight mutation names
the queried ref (its `MutationScope`, which every lane item already carries: `Ref{name}` or
`WholeShard`), plus every lane state other than `Ready` and `Writing` (`Wedged` stays table-wide: a
wedged chunk's items are completed before the tenure ends, so only the lane state records it).
`Writing`, `leader_active` and a non-empty `pending` no longer refuse by themselves. One bookkeeping change: the
runtime keeps `carved` items visible until completion. Revision 1 (gate 0 + part state) was refuted by
the live-repoint trace; revisions 2 to 6 (reading the sent transaction's ops) were correct but heavier
than needed. TLA variant and the two-model consult are mandatory before code.

**Reproduced on the fake, then fixed.** The two-node fake-GCS liveness case
(`tests/integration/test_cas_gcs_relink_liveness`) did not reproduce the starvation at its original
parameters (a 250ms `_ckpt` delay, 40 inserts per node: the run passed). Escalated to a 1000ms delay
and 80 inserts per node, it reproduced cleanly against the table-wide rule 3: both replication queues
stuck at 79 and 80 entries after the drain deadline, and each node logged the confirm refusal over
1,500 times in the run. Against the ref-scoped rule 3 (the final, five-refusal-counter build,
`tests/integration/test_cas_gcs_relink_liveness`'s own captured stdout in `ci/tmp/pytest_parallel.jsonl`
for the run underlying `build/itest_cas_gcs_liveness_task6_fix1.log`) the same escalated workload
produces zero refusals of any kind on BOTH nodes — not one of the five counters at zero on either
node, but no `system.events` row for any of them. That is the intended consequence of the fix, not a
wiring gap: a refusal now needs a queued or carved mutation naming the exact ref the peer is asking
about, and in this workload each node's lane stays busy with its own newer parts while its peer asks
about a part committed only seconds earlier. The escalated case takes about six and a half minutes per
run (up from a few seconds at the original parameters).

**Open items carried forward.**

- Independently corroborated on 2026-09-01 by a workload that is not GCS and not a soak:
  `alter_attach_partition_cas` part 1 on package `26.6.2.20001.altinityantalya`, where
  `ATTACH PARTITION FROM` onto a Replicated destination diverged the replicas and the source answered
  31541 of 31541 confirms `unproven (unknown)` and none `no`. Reported as
  [Altinity/ClickHouse#2310](https://github.com/Altinity/ClickHouse/issues/2310); the package predates
  `a43e2ef89d3` by about a day. That suite is a faster and more natural reproducer than the escalated
  fake-GCS liveness case (six and a half minutes per run), and re-running it against a post-fix build
  is the gate on closing the issue. Triage record and the two items it left open:
  [`BACKLOG/issue-2310.md`](/superpowers/cas/backlog/issue-2310).
- `CASRelinkConfirmRefusedStateLockBusy` is exercised by no test. The `state_mutex` acquisition it
  counts is non-blocking (`try_to_lock`), and nothing in the current code gives a test a seam that
  forces a miss; closing this needs a new test hook, not asked for by this plan.
- No refusal counter's increment is proven to reach `system.events`. All five are registered under
  their names on both live servers, which the live gate established from the `system.metric_log`
  columns, but no refusal path fired live, so the increment step is unproven for every one of them.
  The integration case asserts that `CASRelinkConfirmRefusedLaneWedged` and
  `CASRelinkConfirmRefusedLaneBroken` read zero, which is not evidence either way: a missing row reads
  as a zero, and so does a misspelled or unregistered name. Making that zero non-vacuous costs one
  query per name — `SELECT count() FROM system.events WHERE event = '<name>'
  SETTINGS system_events_show_zero_values = 1` must be 1.
- The liveness case's two escalated constants (the 1000ms checkpoint delay and the 80-insert count)
  were raised together, as one step, once the original parameters failed to reproduce. Nobody has
  measured whether the longer delay alone reproduces the starvation at the original 40-insert count,
  which would roughly halve the suite's six-and-a-half-minute runtime if it does.

**Options considered.**

1. **Narrow rule 3 to a "durable-but-unapplied" flag.** Superseded: `RefLaneState::Writing` already
   spans the `PUT`, the `_ckpt` frontier publication with its 429 backoff, and the apply, so a flag
   raised before the `PUT` would have kept the same long window on GCS. Kept here as the reasoning
   trail.
2. **Bounded wait for quiescence inside the confirm** on `rt.cv` (the leader already notifies).
   Pros: predicate unchanged, tiny. Cons: under continuous load the next tenure starts the instant the
   previous ends, so there is no gap to wait for; holds an interserver handler thread; must not wait
   under `ref_queue_mutex`. Complement at best.
3. **Receiver-side damping.** A per-source circuit breaker (N `Unknown` in a row → pause every relink
   attempt to that source for T) instead of 16 concurrent fetches each on per-entry backoff; possibly
   keep the prepared relink across retries instead of paying precommit + removal per attempt. Pros:
   safety-neutral, stops the self-feeding half, shrinks GC debris. Cons: does not help when the source
   lane is busy with its own merges and inserts, which on GCS is most of the time; keeping the handle
   across queue executions needs state beyond one fetch. **Defense in depth after option 1.**
4. **Let the confirm read the durable journal.** Rejected: the zero-I/O contract exists so a remote
   peer cannot make this writer do work.
5. **Byte-fetch fallback after N failed confirms.** Rejected by taxonomy row 3 in
   `DataPartsExchange.cpp`: the byte request goes to the very source whose state is in doubt. That
   sentence is the taxonomy's reason, not the whole answer, and it does not survive being pressed on
   the `Unknown` branch — a byte fetch establishes its own GC protection through `putBlob` and does
   not rest on the sender's ledger. The objection that does hold is cost, and the bounded shape this
   would have to take if it ever comes back is written out in
   [`BACKLOG/issue-2310.md`](/superpowers/cas/backlog/issue-2310#byte-fallback-note), which is where
   the same proposal arrived from outside.
6. **Shorten tenures on GCS** (the `_ckpt` items below). Necessary anyway, not a liveness guarantee.

**Operational workaround that works today:** alternate `SYSTEM STOP FETCHES` on one replica while the
other drains, then swap; converged the stand to 244,024 = 244,024 rows on 2026-09-02.

**Verification gates for any fix:** the TLA variant green under all sabotage flags; `CAS*` gtest; the
fake-GCS two-node liveness case at escalated parameters (now reproduces the starvation without the
real bucket); a ten-minute phase-3 soak on the real GCS stand as the per-task live gate, read through
the confirm-refusal counters below, with the full two-hour soak run once as the campaign's closing
gate after every fix has landed.

## Failure class 2: hot control keys and the GCS mutation limit (F3, F12) {#gcs-hot-control-keys-429}

- **[gcs-hot-control-keys-429] single-key control objects exceed GCS's one-mutation-per-second object
  limit** — HARD / RELEASE GATE for GCS.

**What happened.** GCS allows about one mutation per second per object name and answers
`429 SlowDown` above it (reads are not limited). Two CAS objects are mutated faster than that.

- `cas/ns/state/<ns>/_ckpt`, one per namespace: a merge-CAS singleton of four fields (`life_epoch`,
  `committed_through`, `checkpoint_snapshot_id`, `last_epoch_seal`), published synchronously inside the
  lane tenure after every durable ref-log chunk as the committed frontier (`CasRefLedger.cpp`, the
  `commit_contribution` publish), plus at birth, epoch seal and snapshot. The path is controlled: 429
  classifies as `Unresolved`, then exact-read, backoff and retry within the request budget
  (`operation_deadline_ms` 90 s, 16 attempts, 0.2 → 5 s backoff). Result: no failed query in the soak,
  1.5k 429s per node in ninety minutes, commit rate per table capped near one per second, tenures
  stretched by backoff (which is what feeds F11), and a `NeedsRecovery` runtime if a budget ever runs
  out.
- `cas/ref_catalog`, one per pool: two CAS writes per `CREATE TABLE` (`Creating`, then `Live`) and two
  per `DROP`. The path is not controlled: `casUpdateImpl` calls `backend.casPut` directly, retries only
  `Conflict` (up to 100 attempts, no backoff) and rethrows any S3 error. The parallel stateless lane
  exceeded the limit at once (1,694 `SlowDown` on the catalog) and about 40% of tests failed at
  `CREATE TABLE` with `S3_ERROR`.

**Options for the catalog.**

- **B1. Route catalog writes through the controlled path** with the ledger's budget. Pros: small,
  symmetric with the lane, DDL stops failing. Cons: `CREATE` may take seconds under contention; the pool
  keeps a ceiling of roughly one lifecycle transition per second; `Conflict` re-read semantics must
  stay. **Preferred first step.**
- **B2. Jittered backoff in the conflict loop** instead of 100 back-to-back attempts. Pros: trivial,
  removes the herd. Cons: no effect on the ceiling. **Do with B1.**
- **B3. Group-commit the catalog** through its own lane, one CAS write for many concurrent transitions.
  Pros: DDL throughput decoupled from the object limit. Cons: new lane machinery with its own liveness
  questions (F11 again); pays off only under mass DDL, which is test suites rather than production.
  Only if needed.
- **B4. Shard the catalog** by namespace hash. Rejected for now: the catalog is the atomic life index
  that proves ownership (INV-3); readers need it whole; a format migration for one provider.
- **B5. Fewer writes per transition** (write `Live` directly). Rejected: two-phase creation is the
  crash-safety mechanism for a stalled `Creating`.

**Options for `_ckpt`.**

- **A1. Coalesce committed-frontier publications** to at most one per T seconds or K flushes per
  namespace, keeping birth, epoch seal and snapshot publications immediate. Pros: an order of magnitude
  fewer mutations; shorter tenures; no new object kinds. Cons: `committed_through` lags, recovery
  replays a longer log tail via LIST, floor cleanup is delayed by T; must show the lag is safe at every
  reader (INV-4 revalidation, cross-epoch GC fold); unmount and shutdown must flush the pending publish.
  **Preferred; the more conservative of the two structural options.**
- **A2. Publish `_ckpt` from an asynchronous publisher** outside the tenure ("after the last flush and
  at least every T"). Pros: the strongest effect on F11, the tenure no longer contains a CAS on a hot
  object. Cons: same lag semantics as A1 plus a background actor with fence and teardown; the
  `NeedsRecovery` path ("journal durable, frontier not installed", an error today) becomes the steady
  state and must be redefined. Alternative to A1 if A1 proves insufficient.
- **A3. Per-object token bucket on the GCS dialect.** Pros: turns 429 storms into orderly local waits,
  fewer requests. Cons: same ceiling; waiting inside the tenure makes F11 worse unless combined with A2.
- **A4. Rotating or generation-suffixed `_ckpt` key.** Rejected: every reader would have to find the
  latest; layout change for one provider.

**Measured again 2026-09-05, 8-minute no-chaos smoke (`ca_live_20260905_r1`, binary with the
single-attempt log-level change, 7ec4d8b0c39 relinked):** GCS answered 429 `The object exceeded the rate
limit for object mutation operations` 175 times on ch1 and 161 times on ch2, every one of them on the
node's own `cas/ns/state/<ns>/_ckpt`, in bursts of 30-45 per minute during the mutations / ttl_pressure
stages (`CASRefBatchFlushes` 408 on ch1 over the run). The engine absorbed all of them
(`CASRequestReissue` 178, `CASRequestResolveRead` 234, zero give-ups, zero failed queries), and the
`WriteBufferFromS3` line for them is now Debug (`S3Exception name SlowDown`), but each 429 still
leaves `<Error> AWSClient: Response status: 429, Too Many Requests` from `PocoHTTPClient`'s status
site, 174 / 161 lines per node -- the third log site named as a follow-up in
`docs/superpowers/cas/2026-09-04-single-attempt-client-log-level-proposal.md`. A1 stays the fix for
the rate; the log site is its own small item in the main BACKLOG.

**The same hot key on AWS S3 answers 409 `ConditionalRequestConflict` (seen 2026-09-05 in a manual test
on a Kubernetes CHI, key `.../cas/ns/state/<ns>/_ckpt`, object size 90):** AWS's error for a conditional
PUT that collides with another in-flight operation on the same object, "The conditional request cannot
succeed due to a conflicting operation against this resource", to be retried. It is NOT a 412 (the
precondition may still hold) and the SDK has no name for it ("Unable to parse ExceptionName"), which
makes the log line confusing: it reads like a refusal while it is the AWS spelling of the very
contention GCS spells as 429. Writers that can overlap on one `_ckpt`: the lane's frontier publish in
`commitRefChunk`, the asynchronous snapshot publisher (`tryPublishSnapshotAndAdvanceCheckpointOnce...`),
and a recovery walk (`runRecoveryWalkOnce` / `requireRecovery`, possibly from another replica). RustFS
and MinIO serialize the two PUTs and answer 412 to the loser, so the 409 never shows up locally.
Engine handling today, verified in `CasRequests.cpp`: the name is in no classification list
(`isDefinitelyRefusedWrite` covers malformed / EntityTooLarge / AccessDenied / credentials only), so it
falls into "outcome unknown" → `Unresolved` → exact resolve read → reissue with backoff inside the
budget; correct and safe, no failed query unless the 90 s budget runs out. The `WriteBufferFromS3` line
is Debug since 08c2a2ec25e; `PocoHTTPClient`'s `Response status: 409` stays Error
(`[single-attempt-client-status-error-log-site]`). When A1 lands, verify on BOTH providers: zero 429
on GCS and zero 409 on AWS for `_ckpt` under the soak's mutations stage; and classify the name
explicitly (a conflict-in-flight class next to `PreconditionFailed`) so the log says what it is.

**Until fixed, document the limit:** roughly one commit per second per table and one namespace
lifecycle transition per second per pool on GCS. `docs/en/antalya/cas/bucket-requirements.md` does not
mention it yet.

## Failure class 3: conditional writes that make exactly one attempt (2026-09-02 audit) {#single-attempt-conditional-writes}

- **[cas-uncontrolled-conditional-writes] twenty-three production call sites issue a conditional write
  with no retry above the single-attempt profile** — HARD for GCS, and the mechanism behind F12.

Full audit, twenty-one object kinds with their coverage and twelve gaps by severity:
[GCS retry-coverage audit](/superpowers/cas/gcs-retry-coverage-audit-2026-09-02). How to stop having
to find these by inspection, in four changes ordered by payoff:
[making retry coverage structural](/superpowers/cas/retry-coverage-by-construction) — the first of
them, private virtuals plus a controller-only handle, turns every future omission into a compile
error and needs no change to any backend implementation or test double.

**The three states, which must not be conflated.** A CAS request is either driven by
`CasRequestController` (up to 16 attempts inside a 90 s deadline, capped-exponential backoff, and an
exact-GET resolve of any ambiguous attempt before it is reissued); or it reaches the object-storage
client unwrapped, where ClickHouse's S3 retry strategy retries `429`, `408` and the retryable `5xx`
up to `s3_retry_attempts`, default 500; or it is a Native-mode conditional write, which
`conditionalWriteSettings` deliberately pins to a single HTTP attempt so that a transparently
retried conditional write can never cross the mount-lease boundary. Reads, `HEAD`s, `LIST`s, exact
deletes and blob publication are all in the second state and are retried heavily. The defect is not
the single-attempt profile; it is the call sites that use it with nothing above them.

**The negative result, which is the audit's most important finding.** A throttling or transport
error cannot be read as "the object is absent" anywhere in the subsystem: `head` flattens only the
genuine not-found codes and `get` only `NoSuchKey`, and the definite-failure classifier whitelists
only malformed-request, entity-too-large and access-denied. No delete, detach, wedge, demotion,
takeover or lifecycle transition can be triggered by a `429` or a `5xx`. Every gap below is
availability, not data loss. The `ProbeOutcome` comment in `Backend/CasBackend.h` claims the
opposite and is wrong; the code is right.

**The gaps worth acting on, in the audit's order.**

- **Critical.** `CasRefCatalog::casUpdateImpl` writes the pool-wide catalog twice per `CREATE TABLE`
  with one attempt, no controller and no catch, so a single `429` fails the statement. This is the
  same item as `[gcs-hot-control-keys-429]`'s B1, now with a call-site inventory behind it.
- **High.** A writable mount issues about twelve single-attempt conditional writes across the
  capability battery, the writer epoch, the lease claim, the keeper adopt and the disk access check;
  one `429` refuses the mount.
- **High.** Loose table files and namespace files go through `CasPlainObjects::casPutObject`, which
  retries only a precondition failure, so a `429` surfaces as `S3_ERROR` to the user's statement.
- **High.** `publishCkpt` re-reads before each reissue, which is correct, but runs up to a hundred
  iterations back-to-back with no sleep against a key whose limit is per-name.
- **Medium.** Both GC liveness signals are single-attempt, so a throttling episode causes leadership
  churn; and any single throttled `PUT` discards a whole GC round.
- **Medium, cross-cutting, and the opposite failure.** A request that IS retried by the S3 client
  retries up to five hundred times with a five-second cap and no jitter, so a persistently throttled
  read, fold or resolve blocks its thread for roughly forty minutes rather than failing fast. The
  CAS operation deadline cannot preempt a request already inside the client's loop.

## Environment findings, recorded so nobody chases them twice {#environment}

- **[gc-run-connect-failure-propagation] a manual `SYSTEM CAS GC RUN` surfaces a connect-level
  failure as `S3_ERROR`** — DESIRABLE — During the provider connect-timeout storm the background
  scheduler simply retried next round; the synchronous command threw to its caller after one failed
  control-object `PUT` and failed a live-gate scenario. Decide whether the manual round should absorb
  transport-level failures the same way. The live gate's manual-round loop is strict by design.
- **[gcs-wan-read-latency] cacheless CAS reads over a WAN** — PERFORMANCE / DOCS — Soak SELECTs on the
  GCS stand: n=537, p50 3.6 s, p99 15.7 s, about 725 `S3GetObject` per query (one ranged GET per column
  file per part, each paying WAN latency). Not a defect; document that a WAN deployment wants a
  `cache` disk in front of the CAS disk, as the stateless lane's optional policy already does.
- **Connect-timeout storm 01:12-01:22 UTC.** Five Google front-end IPs, up to 2.9k timeouts per
  minute on one replica; host conntrack, ports and a fresh connect from the host were all healthy.
  Provider or path. The product's behaviour under it is the positive result recorded above.

## Observability and docs items {#observability}

- **[confirm-refusal-reasons]** — DESIRABLE — `Relink confirm is unproven (unknown)` names no rule.
  A ProfileEvent per refusing rule (residency, warm, lane busy, row mismatch, fence) and the same
  breakdown in the debug line would have cut the F11 investigation from an hour to a minute.
- **[cas-throttling-by-key-class]** — DESIRABLE — ProfileEvents for `SlowDown`/429 on CAS control
  writes by key class (`_ckpt`, `ref_catalog`, `gc/state`, lease objects), so F3/F12 show up as counters
  instead of log greps.
- **[bucket-requirements-gcs-limits]** — DOCS — State the one-mutation-per-second object limit, its
  consequences for commit and DDL rate, and the cache-disk recommendation for WAN reads.

## Harness follow-ups deferred from the campaign reviews {#harness}

- Default container names are duplicated across `soak/chaos.py`, `soak/pool.py`,
  `scenarios/framework/observe.py`; one module should own them.
- `observe.RUSTFS_CONTAINER` is still an import-time constant used by `scenarios/cards/s15_s18_shards_lifecycle.py`,
  `s28_s33_corner.py`, `s34_s35_d1_churn.py` and `scripts/t8_s44_stuck_removing_discrimination.py`; the
  same defect the 2026-09-02 fix removed from `soak`. `lifecycle.DEFAULT_FSCK_CONTAINER` is dead.
- The `object_kind != 'none'` filter in `test_gcs_live` has no local coverage; the stub-driven test
  passes with or without it.

## Recommended order {#order}

1. **B1 + B2 + the observability items.** Small, safety-neutral, unblocks DDL and gives the counters the
   next two steps are read through. Gates: `CAS*` gtest, a 429 mode in `gcs_mocks/server.py`, a short
   stateless-lane sample on GCS without `S3_ERROR` on `CREATE`.
2. **F11, the approved design.** TLA variant, two-model consult, TDD, fresh review. Gate: a ten-minute
   phase-3 soak on the GCS stand.
3. **A1.** After F11, since it shortens tenures but guarantees nothing by itself. Gate: a ten-minute soak
   with 429 counts on `_ckpt` before and after.
4. **Closing gate:** one two-hour phase-3 soak on the GCS stand after every fix has landed, not per task.
5. **By soak results:** F11 option 3 if abort churn still inflates GC; B3 only if mass DDL on GCS is a
   real need; A2 if A1 leaves tenures too long.

Open for brainstorming before code: for A1, which publications stay immediate, the coalescing policy,
the semantics of a lagging `committed_through` for GC fold, cleanup and INV-4, unmount behaviour, and the
new meaning of `NeedsRecovery`; for B1, the DDL budget, tolerance for multi-second `CREATE`,
`Unresolved` handling on the catalog, time-bounding the conflict loop; for F11, the exact flag
semantics across chunked flush and `Unresolved`, the interplay with rule 4, whether `pending` still
matters at all given `build_ops` is a closure whose refs are unknown before carve.
