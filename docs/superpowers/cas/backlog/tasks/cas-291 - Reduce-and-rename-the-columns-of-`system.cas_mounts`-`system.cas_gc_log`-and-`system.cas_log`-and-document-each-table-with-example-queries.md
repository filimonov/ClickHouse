## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
`system.cas_mounts` has 20 columns (`src/Storages/System/StorageSystemContentAddressedMounts.cpp`), `system.cas_gc_log` 29
(`src/Interpreters/ContentAddressedGarbageCollectionLog.cpp`), `system.cas_log` 19 (`src/Interpreters/ContentAddressedLog.cpp`).
Several names describe internals rather than what an operator reads (`min_active_build_sequence`, `gc_fenced`, `renewal_sequence`,
`at_version`). The schema is cheaper to change before the first deployment than after.
Column-level fixes already filed are inputs, not duplicates: CAS-1, CAS-1.1, CAS-1.3, CAS-132, CAS-133, CAS-159.

Provenance: umbrella-roadmap.md section 3 bullet 'Simplify the system tables'; filed 2026-09-26 (user decision). Verified 2026-09-26 against c16a2589f56 (cas-gc-rebuild) and 8d62c314ec1 (altinity/antalya-26.6).

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 A written proposal lists every column of the three tables as keep, rename or drop, with the reason, and the owner approves it
- [ ] #2 The approved schema is implemented; the changed log tables rotate on upgrade in the usual system-log way
- [ ] #3 Each table has a docs page section with at least two example queries that answer an operator question
<!-- AC:END -->

## Definition of Done
<!-- DOD:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 CAS* gtest gate green (utils/cas-gate); LOGICAL_ERROR expectations are death tests
- [ ] #2 ASan lane green for touched suites
- [ ] #3 Docs updated where user-visible (docs/en/antalya/cas) and the spec if the on-S3 format is touched (frozen since 26.6.4: new version + compatibility path)
- [ ] #4 No fallback paths added; failures propagate
