## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
`MergeTreeTransaction::afterCommit` and `rollback` are `noexcept` and write `txn_version.txt` into committed parts; on a CAS disk that is a transaction over a live ref with six throwing steps.
Observed: PR #2300 CI, ASan cas-s3, "Terminate called" on `COMMIT` in `01169_old_alter_partition_isolation_stress` after a routine "append lane not Ready" refusal.
Point fix on cas-gc-rebuild only: `ContentAddressedTransaction::abandonBuildBestEffort` (`fb035142262`, tests `CASCommitRollback.AbandonRefused*DoesNotFailCommit`).
antalya-26.6 lacks it: its `publishStaging` still calls a throwing `st.build->abandon()` after the repoint (`R/ContentAddressedTransaction.cpp:413` at `0dbbd797792`).
Class fix: PR #2396 (open, base antalya-26.6) retries the six metadata writes in one helper for up to 60 s and rethrows on exhaustion or shutdown. Closes #2344.
Rejected: catching at each CAS throw point (hides a lost durable write) and retrying under the lease (turns the abort into a minutes-long `COMMIT`).
The CAS-side surface reduction (one repoint instead of a scratch build) lives in `CAS-15`.

Provenance: BACKLOG/ref-protocol.md#cas-txn-commit-inside-noexcept-aftercommit. Verified 2026-09-26 against b1c34d03479 (point fix fb035142262 is an ancestor) and 0dbbd797792 (point fix absent); PR #2396 state OPEN via gh.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 PR #2396 is merged, or its replacement is, with the failpoint test `05053_transaction_metadata_store_retry` green
- [ ] #2 antalya-26.6 no longer calls a throwing `abandon` after a durable repoint in `publishStaging` (point fix ported or made unnecessary by the class fix, stated in the PR)
- [ ] #3 A forced transient CAS refusal during `COMMIT` on a CAS disk leaves the server running and the transaction visible
<!-- AC:END -->

## Definition of Done
<!-- DOD:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 CAS* gtest gate green (utils/cas-gate); LOGICAL_ERROR expectations are death tests
- [ ] #2 ASan lane green for touched suites
- [ ] #3 Docs updated where user-visible (docs/en/antalya/cas) and the spec if the on-S3 format is touched (frozen since 26.6.4: new version + compatibility path)
- [ ] #4 No fallback paths added; failures propagate
<!-- DOD:END -->
