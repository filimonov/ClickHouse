## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
An 8-second burst of S3 503s on PUT/POST (renew period 10 s, TTL 30 s) fences the mount lease in 2-2.6 s with
`classification=external_lease_deadline` while `watermark_renew.remaining_confirmed_budget_ms` is ~17,000. The next INSERT fails with
Code 210 `mount lease not held`. The last observation at give-up is `present` with an etag, so the mount object was intact.
Reproduced twice on wiped ca-soak pools with `26.6.4.20001.altinityantalya` release: run 1 both replicas fenced (2255 ms / 5 attempts,
1803 ms), run 2 one fenced (2634 ms / 6 attempts) while the other logged `recovered after 8 physical attempts in 3576 ms`. The 40 s fault
also fences after ~2.5 s with ~17 s left instead of at the TTL.
The label comes from `GaveUp{Why::Deadline, Source::Lease}` → `ExternalLeaseDeadline` (`Pool/CasServerRoot.cpp:1692-1695`, both
branches), so the lease-sourced deadline handed to the request engine for the renewal ends far earlier than the confirmed budget says.
CAS-152 (S03, "stopped with 1,969 ms left") may be the same defect; this is the first dev-scale reproduction.

Provenance: GitHub issue #2431 (open, no assignee), reconciled by u17-github-cas; verified 2026-09-26 against cae9288ee65 (cas-gc-rebuild) and altinity/antalya-26.6. Related CAS-152, CAS-150. Soak rig, not a real deployment, so no origin:canary.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 A test injects an 8 s 503 window on mount-object writes; the renewal commits after the window and no `fenced after` line is logged
- [ ] #2 With the window held past the TTL, the fence happens no earlier than the confirmed deadline minus the configured margin
- [ ] #3 `remaining_confirmed_budget_ms` at give-up and the lease deadline the engine was bound to are logged together, and agree
- [ ] #4 S39's short-fault check queries every replica, not only `clickhouse1`
<!-- AC:END -->

## Definition of Done
<!-- DOD:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 CAS* gtest gate green (utils/cas-gate); LOGICAL_ERROR expectations are death tests
- [ ] #2 ASan lane green for touched suites
- [ ] #3 Docs updated where user-visible (docs/en/antalya/cas) and the spec if the on-S3 format is touched (frozen since 26.6.4: new version + compatibility path)
- [ ] #4 No fallback paths added; failures propagate
