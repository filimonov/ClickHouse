## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
The first deployment blocks on monitoring and alerts (roadmap section 1). No dashboard exists in the repo; the only generic assets are
`programs/server/dashboard.html` and `system.dashboards` (`src/Storages/System/StorageSystemDashboards.cpp`).
Audit F25 lists the signals worth a panel from a week of canary data and the ones that mislead: lane wait and mutations per flush,
GC stage flow (condemned, graduated, redeleted), LIST rate, the memory saw-tooth per GC round, mount renewals, conditional-write
unresolved rate. It also names what not to use: `S3ReadRequestsErrors` counts the protocol's HEAD-before-PUT misses.
Two parts: the board and the alert rules. CAS-4 maps the alert signals onto existing surfaces.

Provenance: umbrella-roadmap.md section 3 bullet 'Grafana dashboard'; filed 2026-09-26 (user decision). Related: CAS-4, CAS-2. Verified 2026-09-26 against c16a2589f56 (cas-gc-rebuild) and 8d62c314ec1 (altinity/antalya-26.6).

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 A dashboard JSON and alert rules are in the repo and load in Grafana against the ClickHouse data source
- [ ] #2 `operations/monitoring.md` links both and explains each panel and alert
<!-- AC:END -->

## Definition of Done
<!-- DOD:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 CAS* gtest gate green (utils/cas-gate); LOGICAL_ERROR expectations are death tests
- [ ] #2 ASan lane green for touched suites
- [ ] #3 Docs updated where user-visible (docs/en/antalya/cas) and the spec if the on-S3 format is touched (frozen since 26.6.4: new version + compatibility path)
- [ ] #4 No fallback paths added; failures propagate
