## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
RustFS returned false 404s under load and kept overwritten versions (rustfs#3231), which capped merge-heavy full-scale runs
and the 4 h chaos soak. CAS is safe against it (clamp plus destruction suppression). Upstream reports it fixed, but the ca-soak
configs still pin `rustfs/rustfs:1.0.0-rc.3` (ten pins under `utils/ca-soak`), never checked against the fix.
The ~400x physical-footprint figure blamed on it holds only for many-tiny-object soaks; do not generalise it.

Provenance: BACKLOG/formats-and-storage.md [F2 / rustfs#3231]; absorbs u06's dropped [physical-footprint amplification]. Verified 2026-09-26 against 8b87aa15d21 (cas-gc-rebuild).
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 The pinned version is compared with the version that carries the fix, and the result is recorded in `RUN_HISTORY.md`
- [ ] #2 If a fixed image exists, the pins move to it and one full-scale merge-heavy soak runs clean
<!-- AC:END -->

## Definition of Done
<!-- DOD:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 CAS* gtest gate green (utils/cas-gate); LOGICAL_ERROR expectations are death tests
- [ ] #2 ASan lane green for touched suites
- [ ] #3 Docs updated where user-visible (docs/en/antalya/cas) and the spec if the on-S3 format is touched (frozen since 26.6.4: new version + compatibility path)
- [ ] #4 No fallback paths added; failures propagate
