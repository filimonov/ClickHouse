## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
No `statvfs`/free-space check exists under `CA/` before a local staging write, and `.tmp` files in `scratch_path`
(`CA/ContentAddressedTransaction.cpp:1010`, `:1865`) left by an unclean restart are never removed; the S3 staging prefix has a
sweeper, local scratch does not. ENOSPC is already fail-loud (audit verdict), so this is about early refusal and leaked disk.

Provenance: BACKLOG/operability-and-introspection.md#disk-error-audit-followups-2026-07-21 (DESIRABLE scratch_path guard); verified 2026-09-26 against dd0ed2f263a and 0dbbd797792.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Mount removes scratch files of this server older than the process start
- [ ] #2 A local staging write below a configurable free-space floor fails with a clear error before writing
<!-- AC:END -->

## Definition of Done
<!-- DOD:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 CAS* gtest gate green (utils/cas-gate); LOGICAL_ERROR expectations are death tests
- [ ] #2 ASan lane green for touched suites
- [ ] #3 Docs updated where user-visible (docs/en/antalya/cas) and the spec if the on-S3 format is touched (frozen since 26.6.4: new version + compatibility path)
- [ ] #4 No fallback paths added; failures propagate
<!-- DOD:END -->

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Merged from CAS-101: the full-scale campaign saw local scratch grow 1 -> 21 MiB over an idle window with no user inserts (attribution stays in CAS-101). Scratch files are the local-staging spill of `CaContentWriteBuffer` and the inline-overflow spill in `ContentAddressedTransaction.cpp`; each is removed by its writer on success or failure, so only a crashed process leaves them. A test leaves a stale file and remounts.

First recorded: 2026-09-26 (filed during the Backlog.md migration; no earlier trace in docs/superpowers history)

2031-triage CAS-046: local scratch is unreserved, unaccounted and never swept at startup; the ledger (#cas-046) maps the `statvfs` guard and orphan sweep to this item. Sizing docs half is CAS-102.
