## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
`CasGcScheduler::stop` sets `stopping`, notifies and then joins (`CA/Gc/CasGcScheduler.cpp:101-119`): a round in flight runs to completion,
and the verb waits for it. The round's destructive work is count-capped (`GcRoundWorkBudget`, `CA/Gc/CasBlobInDegree.h:267`) but has no time
budget, so against a slow bucket the wait is whatever the bucket makes it.
Server shutdown and the storage destructor are already bounded (teardown flag, `history/2026-09-04-cas-gc-teardown-stop-design.md` rev.5).
Neither verb may reuse that pool-wide flag: `GC STOP` must not refuse unrelated `cas_mounts` queries or a running FSCK, and FORGET cannot arm it
because a latched self-remount's identity probe is admitted on the same plane. Both need a round-scoped stop token.
Spec stage C1 (`cas_gc_round_deadline_sec`, `remaining()` checks before each window) gives the natural cut points; the token can make `remaining()` zero.
Stopping mid-round is safe: every step is crash-safe, so a stopped round equals a crashed leader.

Provenance: BACKLOG/operability-and-introspection.md#lifecycle-verbs-wait-out-uncancellable-scans, GC-round half (2031-triage CAS-049); verified 2026-09-26 against 59494ebf366 (cas-gc-rebuild) and 0dbbd797792 (altinity/antalya-26.6). Easiest after spec stage C1 lands.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 `SYSTEM CAS GC STOP` returns within one S3 request of the current phase boundary while a round is in flight, proven by a test with a slowed backend
- [ ] #2 `SYSTEM CAS FORGET` does the same without arming the pool-wide teardown flag
- [ ] #3 A running FSCK and `system.cas_mounts` queries are unaffected by either verb
- [ ] #4 The next round after `GC START` completes normally and fsck reports no new findings
<!-- AC:END -->

## Definition of Done
<!-- DOD:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 CAS* gtest gate green (utils/cas-gate); LOGICAL_ERROR expectations are death tests
- [ ] #2 ASan lane green for touched suites
- [ ] #3 Docs updated where user-visible (docs/en/antalya/cas) and the spec if the on-S3 format is touched (frozen since 26.6.4: new version + compatibility path)
- [ ] #4 No fallback paths added; failures propagate
