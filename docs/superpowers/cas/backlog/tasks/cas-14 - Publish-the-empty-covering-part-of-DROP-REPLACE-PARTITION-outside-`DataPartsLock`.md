## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
`MergeTreeData::removePartsInRangeFromWorkingSetAndGetPartsToRemoveFromZooKeeper` (`src/Storages/MergeTree/MergeTreeData.cpp:5883`) creates the empty covering part and, on a CA disk, calls `commitTransaction` on it (`:5980`) inside the caller's `DataPartsLock`, so the whole remote commit (manifest PUT, ref-lane flush) holds the table's parts lock.
Low impact: the part is empty, the trigger is DDL-only, failures are loud (2031-triage CAS-048, P3).
Fix needs a 3-phase caller restructuring: compute the range under the lock, release, publish, re-acquire and re-validate. A design task, not a code move; share the seam with `part-upload-before-partslock` if it fits.

Provenance: BACKLOG/performance.md#covering-part-publish-under-datapartslock (2031-triage CAS-048). Verified 2026-09-26 against aefe80eba98 and 0dbbd797792.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 The empty cover's manifest PUT and ref-lane flush run with `DataPartsLock` released, verified by `PartsLockHoldMicroseconds` on a DROP PARTITION over a CA disk
- [ ] #2 A concurrent insert into the dropped range during the unlocked window is either covered or rejected, proven by a test
<!-- AC:END -->

## Definition of Done
<!-- DOD:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 CAS* gtest gate green (utils/cas-gate); LOGICAL_ERROR expectations are death tests
- [ ] #2 ASan lane green for touched suites
- [ ] #3 Docs updated where user-visible (docs/en/antalya/cas) and the spec if the on-S3 format is touched (frozen since 26.6.4: new version + compatibility path)
- [ ] #4 No fallback paths added; failures propagate
<!-- DOD:END -->
