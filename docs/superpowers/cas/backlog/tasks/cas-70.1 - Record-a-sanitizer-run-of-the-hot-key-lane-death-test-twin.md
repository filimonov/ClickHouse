## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
`CASRefCatalogDeathTest.AStaleHintCasAdmitEntryAdmitsWhenTheStoreHasRoomAborts` (`src/Disks/tests/gtest_cas_ref_catalog.cpp:2516`, both branches) is recorded as never executed under a debug or sanitizer build (phase A plan, Task 6 step 2).
Altinity CI runs `Unit tests (asan_ubsan)`, `(tsan)` and `(msan)` on pull requests, so it has likely run since the lane landed; no report proving it was found.
Either cite a CI unit-test report where it passed, or run `CASRefCatalog*:CASHotKeys.*` once in a local ASan build.

Provenance: BACKLOG/performance.md#hot-key-lane-phase-a-followups (first outstanding bullet). Verified 2026-09-26 against 59494ebf366 and 0dbbd797792.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 A link to a CI unit-test report, or a local ASan log, shows the death test and the `CASHotKeys.*` suite passing
- [ ] #2 The phase A plan's status table is updated to reference that evidence
<!-- AC:END -->

## Definition of Done
<!-- DOD:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 CAS* gtest gate green (utils/cas-gate); LOGICAL_ERROR expectations are death tests
- [ ] #2 ASan lane green for touched suites
- [ ] #3 Docs updated where user-visible (docs/en/antalya/cas) and the spec if the on-S3 format is touched (frozen since 26.6.4: new version + compatibility path)
- [ ] #4 No fallback paths added; failures propagate
