## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
In the T8 criterion-4 injection the lane stayed in `CASRefNeedsRecovery` for ~20 minutes, including after the byte-identical original `_ckpt`
was restored. `NeedsRecovery` is a hard lane fence (`CA/Pool/CasRefLedger.cpp:1439-1443`). One observation only: it may be a wedge,
a remount-only exit, or an artifact of the injected shape. No test found restores the object and asserts the lane recovers.
If the only exit is a remount, the runbook must say so and recovery should retry on its own; if it is a wedge, file a bug.

Provenance: BACKLOG/operability-and-introspection.md#damaged-object-repair item 3; verified 2026-09-26 against 59494ebf366 (cas-gc-rebuild) and 0dbbd797792 (altinity/antalya-26.6).

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 A deterministic test damages a `_ckpt` under a live writer, restores it, and records whether and how the lane leaves `NeedsRecovery`
- [ ] #2 The outcome is written down: self-heals, needs remount, or a new bug task with the repro
<!-- AC:END -->

## Definition of Done
<!-- DOD:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 CAS* gtest gate green (utils/cas-gate); LOGICAL_ERROR expectations are death tests
- [ ] #2 ASan lane green for touched suites
- [ ] #3 Docs updated where user-visible (docs/en/antalya/cas) and the spec if the on-S3 format is touched (frozen since 26.6.4: new version + compatibility path)
- [ ] #4 No fallback paths added; failures propagate
