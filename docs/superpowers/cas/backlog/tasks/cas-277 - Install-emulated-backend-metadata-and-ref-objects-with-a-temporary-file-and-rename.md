## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Blob bodies on the emulated backend are installed atomically (`emuPublishBlobAtomically`, `CA/Backend/CasObjectStorageBackend.cpp:488`),
but ordinary metadata and ref writes go through `emuWrite` (`:478`, called `:867`) and `LocalObjectStorage::writeObject` on the
final key with `O_TRUNC`. A concurrent reader of the same key can see a half-written object; the known case is two concurrent
fetches writing one `detached/<part>` ref. Safe on S3 (atomic PUT). CI, unit tests and local pools only.

Provenance: BACKLOG/formats-and-storage.md [B66a]; the POSIX backend would retire it. Verified 2026-09-26 against 8b87aa15d21 (cas-gc-rebuild) and 8d62c314ec1 (altinity/antalya-26.6).

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Mutable emulated writes go through a sibling temporary file plus rename, keeping the existing lock and token semantics
- [ ] #2 A gtest with a concurrent reader never observes a partial object
<!-- AC:END -->

## Definition of Done
<!-- DOD:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 CAS* gtest gate green (utils/cas-gate); LOGICAL_ERROR expectations are death tests
- [ ] #2 ASan lane green for touched suites
- [ ] #3 Docs updated where user-visible (docs/en/antalya/cas) and the spec if the on-S3 format is touched (frozen since 26.6.4: new version + compatibility path)
- [ ] #4 No fallback paths added; failures propagate
<!-- DOD:END -->
