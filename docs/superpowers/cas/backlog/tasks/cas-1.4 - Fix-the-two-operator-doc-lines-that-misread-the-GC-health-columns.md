## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
GC-health columns are NULL on every peer row by design (`docs/en/antalya/cas/architecture/mounts-and-leases.md:270`).
`operations/migration.md:206` still tells the operator to check the victim's `last_success_age_seconds` before
`SYSTEM CAS DROP POOL MEMBER`; the victim's row never carries it, and the liveness signals are `state` and `expires_at`.
`operations/troubleshooting.md:20` offers "`last_success_age_seconds` not climbing" as evidence the mount lease is
renewing; GC success and lease renewal are unrelated clocks. Prose-only: batch with the deferred docs pass.

Provenance: BACKLOG/operability-and-introspection.md#gc-health-zero-is-ambiguous item 4; verified 2026-09-26 against aefe80eba98 (cas-gc-rebuild).
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 `migration.md` names `state` and `expires_at` as the victim's liveness signals and no longer mentions GC-health columns there
- [ ] #2 `troubleshooting.md` checks lease renewal only through `expires_at` moving forward
<!-- AC:END -->

## Definition of Done
<!-- DOD:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 CAS* gtest gate green (utils/cas-gate); LOGICAL_ERROR expectations are death tests
- [ ] #2 ASan lane green for touched suites
- [ ] #3 Docs updated where user-visible (docs/en/antalya/cas) and the spec if the on-S3 format is touched (frozen since 26.6.4: new version + compatibility path)
- [ ] #4 No fallback paths added; failures propagate
