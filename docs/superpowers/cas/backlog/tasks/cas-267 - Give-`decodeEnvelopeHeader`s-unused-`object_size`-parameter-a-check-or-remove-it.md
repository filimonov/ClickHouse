## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
`decodeEnvelopeHeader(std::string_view, uint64_t /*object_size*/, ObjectKind)` (`CA/Formats/CasBlobEnvelopeFormat.cpp:235`)
ignores the size its two callers pass (`CA/ContentAddressedTransaction.cpp:317`, S3-staging retag; `CA/Tools/CasInspect.cpp:548`).
The read path locates the payload by the pool's `blob_header_len`, not by the object's envelope, by design. A wrong offset
hands MergeTree shifted bytes, which its compressed-block checksums reject, so this is not an integrity gap.
Decide also whether fsck `detail` mode samples one envelope to prove `header_len == blob_header_len`.

Provenance: BACKLOG/formats-and-storage.md#blob-envelope-never-read-back (2031-triage CAS-089); verified 2026-09-26 against 8b87aa15d21 (cas-gc-rebuild).
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 The parameter is either checked (for example `header_len <= object_size`) with a gtest, or removed from the signature
- [ ] #2 The fsck sampling question has a recorded yes or no; a yes adds the check
<!-- AC:END -->

## Definition of Done
<!-- DOD:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 CAS* gtest gate green (utils/cas-gate); LOGICAL_ERROR expectations are death tests
- [ ] #2 ASan lane green for touched suites
- [ ] #3 Docs updated where user-visible (docs/en/antalya/cas) and the spec if the on-S3 format is touched (frozen since 26.6.4: new version + compatibility path)
- [ ] #4 No fallback paths added; failures propagate
