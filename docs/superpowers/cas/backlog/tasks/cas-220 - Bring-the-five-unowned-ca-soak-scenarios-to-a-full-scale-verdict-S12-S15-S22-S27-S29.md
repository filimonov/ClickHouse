## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
`utils/ca-soak/scenarios/RUN_HISTORY.md` has `full`-scale rows for 20 scenarios. Unresolved and not owned by another task:
S15 is inconclusive on a card bug (`:596`, `Code: 41 Cannot read DateTime: unexpected number of decimal`); S29 is inconclusive (`:347`, `:599`);
S12, S22 and S27 are green at `ci` scale but have never run at `full`.
Owned elsewhere: S03 (`u10-mounts:renewal-budget-gap-s03-full-rerun`), S05 (CAS-99), S23 (CAS-97), S01 (CAS-100), S07 (CAS-104), S10 (CAS-98), S11 (CAS-106).

Provenance: BACKLOG/testing-and-ci.md [ci-full-scale-sweep]; verified 2026-09-26 against 8b87aa15d21. The 'RSS-attribution / manifest-cap measurement doc' sub-point is carried by CAS-100 and CAS-107.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Every subtask is done and each of the five scenarios has a `full`-scale row in `RUN_HISTORY.md` with pass or fail
<!-- AC:END -->

## Definition of Done
<!-- DOD:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 CAS* gtest gate green (utils/cas-gate); LOGICAL_ERROR expectations are death tests
- [ ] #2 ASan lane green for touched suites
- [ ] #3 Docs updated where user-visible (docs/en/antalya/cas) and the spec if the on-S3 format is touched (frozen since 26.6.4: new version + compatibility path)
- [ ] #4 No fallback paths added; failures propagate
