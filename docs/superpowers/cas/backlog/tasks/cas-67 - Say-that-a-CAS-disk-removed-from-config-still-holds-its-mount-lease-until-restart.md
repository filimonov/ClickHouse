## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Removing a CAS disk from `storage_configuration` and reloading produces only the generic "disappeared from configuration, this change will be
applied after restart" warning (`src/Disks/DiskSelector.cpp:217`); the disk is not shut down. For a CAS disk the mount lease keeps being
heartbeaten, so its `server_root_id` slot cannot be taken over by another server before a restart. Same disk-registry-caches-forever class
as `mounts-and-lifecycle.md#disk-lifecycle-rev8-closure`, bounded by the restart. Short-term fix: a CAS-specific line naming the retained lease
and the `SYSTEM CAS FORGET` verb.

Provenance: BACKLOG/operability-and-introspection.md#cas-settings-not-reloadable-silently, removed-disk half; verified 2026-09-26 against 59494ebf366 (cas-gc-rebuild) and 0dbbd797792 (altinity/antalya-26.6). Superseded if the disk-lifecycle redesign (UNMOUNT ejects) lands first.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Removing a CAS disk from config and reloading logs a line naming the disk, the retained lease and `SYSTEM CAS FORGET`
- [ ] #2 `docs/en/antalya/cas/configuration.md` states that removing a CAS disk from config takes effect only after restart or `SYSTEM CAS FORGET`
<!-- AC:END -->

## Definition of Done
<!-- DOD:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 CAS* gtest gate green (utils/cas-gate); LOGICAL_ERROR expectations are death tests
- [ ] #2 ASan lane green for touched suites
- [ ] #3 Docs updated where user-visible (docs/en/antalya/cas) and the spec if the on-S3 format is touched (frozen since 26.6.4: new version + compatibility path)
- [ ] #4 No fallback paths added; failures propagate

2031-triage CAS-107: the removed-disk half (mount lease renewed until restart); reload half is CAS-66. Audit ranks CAS-107 #5 in 'Where to start'.
