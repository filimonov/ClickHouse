## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Scheduled removal, not a defect. `ContentAddressedSettings::loadFromConfig` (`CA/ContentAddressedSettings.cpp:115-222`) still accepts the unprefixed
spelling, applies it and emits one aggregated `LOG_WARNING` (`:218-222`). While the window is open, a stale config runs with a warning nobody reads.
Trigger: the CAS configurations in the `clickhouse-regression` suite are on the `cas_` spelling (external; not checkable from this repo).
Work: replace the warning and apply loop with a throw listing every unprefixed name and its `cas_` spelling; rewrite
`LegacySpellingStillLoadsDuringMigrationWindow` and `PartialMigrationLoadsAndReportsEveryLegacyKey` (`src/Disks/tests/gtest_cas_settings.cpp:248`, `:256`)
into one test that pins the rejection; drop the deprecation text from `docs/en/antalya/cas/configuration.md` (section `#migration-from-unprefixed-keys`)
and `docs/en/operations/storing-data.md`. Keep this separate from the spec C2 rule that removed `cas_gc_round_*` keys stay accepted as no-ops for one release.

Provenance: BACKLOG/operability-and-introspection.md#cas-config-prefix-window (landed with 917600b122b); verified 2026-09-26 against 59494ebf366 (cas-gc-rebuild) and 0dbbd797792 (altinity/antalya-26.6). Blocked on the external clickhouse-regression migration.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 A config with an unprefixed CAS setting fails disk creation with an error naming the key and its `cas_` spelling
- [ ] #2 The migration tests are replaced by one test pinning the rejection, and the deprecation text is gone from both docs
<!-- AC:END -->

## Definition of Done
<!-- DOD:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 CAS* gtest gate green (utils/cas-gate); LOGICAL_ERROR expectations are death tests
- [ ] #2 ASan lane green for touched suites
- [ ] #3 Docs updated where user-visible (docs/en/antalya/cas) and the spec if the on-S3 format is touched (frozen since 26.6.4: new version + compatibility path)
- [ ] #4 No fallback paths added; failures propagate
