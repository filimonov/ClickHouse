## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
No `ProfileEvents` split `SlowDown` / 429 on CAS control writes by key class (`_ckpt`, `ref_catalog`, `gc/state`, lease objects); the generic `S3WriteRequestsThrottling` has no key.
otel.demo: 537 throttling events in the week, 49-154 per day outside restarts; the audit could only infer by correlation that the throttled requests are the writers' `_log` / `_ckpt` / manifest PUTs (F26, PLAUSIBLE). `blob_storage_log` does not record throttled attempts that later succeed (F29).
Needed as the before/after measurement for A1 (`_ckpt`), spec B1 (GC LIST removal) and hot-key phase B (`ref_catalog`).
New events must pass the event rule of CAS-2 (recurring operating state that changes operator action); throttling per key class does.

Provenance: BACKLOG/gcs.md#environment [cas-throttling-by-key-class]. Verified 2026-09-26: no such event in src/Common/ProfileEvents.cpp at 8b87aa15d21 or 8d62c314ec1.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Per-key-class throttling counters exist and a gtest on an injected `SlowDown` increments exactly the class of the key
- [ ] #2 `docs/en/antalya/cas/operations/monitoring.md` lists the new events
- [ ] #3 One soak or stand reading records the split, turning audit F26 into a measured fact
<!-- AC:END -->

## Definition of Done
<!-- DOD:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 CAS* gtest gate green (utils/cas-gate); LOGICAL_ERROR expectations are death tests
- [ ] #2 ASan lane green for touched suites
- [ ] #3 Docs updated where user-visible (docs/en/antalya/cas) and the spec if the on-S3 format is touched (frozen since 26.6.4: new version + compatibility path)
- [ ] #4 No fallback paths added; failures propagate
