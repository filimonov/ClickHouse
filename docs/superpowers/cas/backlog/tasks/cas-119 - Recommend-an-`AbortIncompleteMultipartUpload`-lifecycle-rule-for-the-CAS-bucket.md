## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
CAS writes through `WriteBufferFromS3`, which aborts multipart uploads on cancel and in its destructor, so only a process
kill or a failed `AbortMultipartUpload` leaves parts behind, billed until a bucket lifecycle rule expires them. Same as any
ClickHouse S3 disk, but CAS docs promise pool byte accounting, and fsck `physical_bytes` counts only listed blob bodies
(`CA/Tools/CasFsck.cpp:746`, `:760`, `:1075`). No mention of the rule in `docs/en/antalya/cas/` on either branch. Cost only.

Provenance: BACKLOG/operability-and-introspection.md#mpu-and-probe-debris-unaccounted (multipart half; 2031-triage CAS-082); verified 2026-09-26 against dd0ed2f263a and 0dbbd797792. Per-class byte accounting is u07-oper-a:fsck-per-class-byte-accounting.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 `bucket-requirements.md` or the operations docs recommend an `AbortIncompleteMultipartUpload` lifecycle rule with an example
- [ ] #2 The fsck docs say `physical_bytes` counts committed objects, not in-flight multipart parts
<!-- AC:END -->

## Definition of Done
<!-- DOD:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 CAS* gtest gate green (utils/cas-gate); LOGICAL_ERROR expectations are death tests
- [ ] #2 ASan lane green for touched suites
- [ ] #3 Docs updated where user-visible (docs/en/antalya/cas) and the spec if the on-S3 format is touched (frozen since 26.6.4: new version + compatibility path)
- [ ] #4 No fallback paths added; failures propagate
