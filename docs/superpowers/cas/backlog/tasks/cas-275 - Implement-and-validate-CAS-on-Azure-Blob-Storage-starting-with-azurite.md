## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
AWS S3 and GCS passed real-store exact-delete and GC validation (2026-07-03); Azure never started. `CA/` has no Azure backend,
only an enum entry in `CA/Primitives/CasTypes.h`. Roadmap §1 lists Azure with azurite under "More backends".
First decide whether to build the provider-neutral conditional-operations layer from
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-21-cas-object-storage-conditional-operations-proposal.md`; the refactor is justified mainly if
Azure is the next backend. Azure needs the same contracts as S3/GCS: conditional create and replace, token-exact delete,
trusted cold LIST (decision-2), mandatory blob HEAD before PUT (decision-1).

Provenance: BACKLOG/formats-and-storage.md [GATE #1: Azure]; verified 2026-09-26 against 8b87aa15d21 (cas-gc-rebuild) and 8d62c314ec1 (altinity/antalya-26.6).
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 The conditional-operations layer decision is recorded
- [ ] #2 A CAS disk on azurite passes the mount capability probe and the CAS integration battery
- [ ] #3 Exact-delete and a GC round are validated on a real Azure account
<!-- AC:END -->

## Definition of Done
<!-- DOD:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 CAS* gtest gate green (utils/cas-gate); LOGICAL_ERROR expectations are death tests
- [ ] #2 ASan lane green for touched suites
- [ ] #3 Docs updated where user-visible (docs/en/antalya/cas) and the spec if the on-S3 format is touched (frozen since 26.6.4: new version + compatibility path)
- [ ] #4 No fallback paths added; failures propagate
