## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Only `ch1` has the `/ping` healthcheck (`utils/ca-soak/docker-compose.yml:91-96`, added to serialize capability probes);
`docker-compose-asan.yml` and `-tsan.yml` have none. So "container healthy while HTTP dead" on `ch2` is vacuous, which is how
issue #2233's report read. Trivial.

Provenance: BACKLOG/operability-and-introspection.md#issue-2233-followups item (1); verified 2026-09-26 against dd0ed2f263a.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Every ca-soak compose file defines the same HTTP healthcheck on every ClickHouse service
- [ ] #2 `docker compose ps` reports `ch2` unhealthy within one probe interval after its HTTP port stops answering
<!-- AC:END -->

## Definition of Done
<!-- DOD:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 CAS* gtest gate green (utils/cas-gate); LOGICAL_ERROR expectations are death tests
- [ ] #2 ASan lane green for touched suites
- [ ] #3 Docs updated where user-visible (docs/en/antalya/cas) and the spec if the on-S3 format is touched (frozen since 26.6.4: new version + compatibility path)
- [ ] #4 No fallback paths added; failures propagate
