## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
The renewal runs on a plain `ThreadFromGlobalPool` (`CA/Pool/CasMountRuntime.cpp:578`, `:606`, loop at `:643`) with no thread group,
so its allocations are charged to the global tracker and can throw `MEMORY_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` above `max_server_memory_usage`.
One terminal renewal trips the mount; an exception outside the inner `try` reaches the catch-all (`CasMountRuntime.cpp:717-742`),
which trips the fence and ends the renewal thread for good.
Each attempt allocates ~1 MiB for the PUT buffer and ~1 MiB for a settling read. `conditionalWriteSettings`
(`CA/Backend/CasObjectStorageBackend.cpp:805`) does not set `s3_allow_parallel_part_upload = false`, so the PUT runs on a remote-FS pool thread.
Unfixed on both branches: no `LockMemoryExceptionInThread` anywhere under `CA/`.
Fix per the issue: hold `LockMemoryExceptionInThread(VariableContext::Global)` per renewal iteration (precedent `KeeperServer.cpp:397`,
`TransactionLog.cpp:491`), keep the control-plane PUT on the renewal thread, size control-plane buffers to the payload.
Rejected: `MemoryTrackerBlockerInThread` (hides accounting), classifying the error as deterministic, a longer budget.
Item 4 of the issue (carry the transport error into `GaveUp`) is CAS-50.

Provenance: umbrella-roadmap.md section 4 bullet 'Mount lease under memory pressure' (#2403); filed 2026-09-26 (user decision). Related: CAS-50, CAS-152. Verified 2026-09-26 against c16a2589f56 (cas-gc-rebuild) and 8d62c314ec1 (altinity/antalya-26.6).

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 With the global tracker held above its limit, renewals keep committing and the mount is not lost; without the change the same test reports a terminal renewal
- [ ] #2 A fault-injected `MEMORY_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` on the renewal path neither ends the renewal thread nor trips the fence
- [ ] #3 The control-plane PUT runs on the `CAS_LEASE_RENEWER` thread, and the renewal's memory still shows in the server's accounting
<!-- AC:END -->

## Definition of Done
<!-- DOD:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 CAS* gtest gate green (utils/cas-gate); LOGICAL_ERROR expectations are death tests
- [ ] #2 ASan lane green for touched suites
- [ ] #3 Docs updated where user-visible (docs/en/antalya/cas) and the spec if the on-S3 format is touched (frozen since 26.6.4: new version + compatibility path)
- [ ] #4 No fallback paths added; failures propagate
<!-- DOD:END -->

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
First recorded: 2026-09-25 (74f60f0a3a5, by 'https://github.com/Altinity/ClickHouse/issues/2403')

Merged from the GitHub reconciliation (u17, would have been a duplicate task for #2403): The renewal thread has no thread group, so its allocations go to the global tracker and can throw `MEMORY_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` whenever the server is above `max_server_memory_usage`. One terminal renewal loses the mount; an exception outside the inner `try` reaches the loop's catch-all (`Pool/CasMountRuntime.cpp:717`, loop at `:643`) and ends the renewal thread for good. A transient memory condition therefore takes down something that must never stop. Unfixed on both branches (no `LockMemoryExceptionInThread` in the file). Each attempt allocates ~1 MiB for the PUT buffer plus ~1 MiB for a settling read; the PUT runs on the remote-FS write pool because `conditionalWriteSettings` (`Backend/CasObjectStorageBackend.cpp:805`) keeps `s3_allow_parallel_part_upload = true`, so a guard on the renewal thread would not cover it. Fix (issue proposal): hold `LockMemoryExceptionInThread(VariableContext::Global)` across a renewal iteration (precedent: `KeeperServer.cpp:397`, `TransactionLog.cpp:491`); disable parallel part upload for control-plane writes with a comment saying why; size control-plane buffers to the payload. The "name the transport error in `GaveUp`" part is CAS-50. Rejected: `MemoryTrackerBlockerInThread` (hides the memory), classifying the limit as deterministic (fails faster), a longer budget. AC to keep: With the global tracker held above its limit, the renewal keeps committing and the mount stays Live; without the change the same test reports a terminal renewal; A fault-injected memory-limit exception on the renewal path neither ends the renewal thread nor trips the fence; The control-plane PUT is issued on the renewal thread, not a remote-FS write-pool thread; The renewal's allocations still show up in server memory accounting
