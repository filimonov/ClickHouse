## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
The roadmap lists "defaults reviewed" as a first-deployment blocker. There are 31 CAS disk settings (`CA/ContentAddressedSettings.cpp`)
plus MergeTree and S3 settings that CAS relies on.
Defaults with evidence against them already: `gc_round_ref_cleanup_budget` 5000 (the cap caused the `_log` growth loop, audit F14;
spec C2 / CAS-29.11 removes the budgets), `manifest_decode_cache_bytes` 128 MiB (full on the canary, F25), `part_folder_cache_bytes`
64 MiB (weight bug CAS-22), keep-alive (one new TLS connection per ~98 requests, F27; CAS-283, CAS-74),
`concurrent_part_removal_threshold_for_remote_disk` 16.
Lease and request timing: `mount_lease_ttl_ms` 30000, `mount_renew_period_ms` 10000, `attempt_timeout_ms` 5000,
`lease_safety_margin_ms` 2000. Concurrency: `gc_read_concurrency` 16, `gc_meta_pool_size` 16, `gc_shards` 1, `gc_interval_sec` 60.
Inputs from other tasks: the decode-cache and parallel-removal tasks of this unit, CAS-107 (sizing model), CAS-128 (unexposed knobs).

Provenance: umbrella-roadmap.md section 7 bullet 'Defaults review before the first deployment'; filed 2026-09-26 (user decision). Verified 2026-09-26 against c16a2589f56 (cas-gc-rebuild) and 8d62c314ec1 (altinity/antalya-26.6).

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 A table lists every CAS setting with its default, the evidence (soak, canary, or none) and a keep or change decision
- [ ] #2 Every changed default is applied, with the old value noted for `compatibility` where the setting is user-visible
- [ ] #3 `configuration.md` states for each setting when an operator should change it
<!-- AC:END -->

## Definition of Done
<!-- DOD:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 CAS* gtest gate green (utils/cas-gate); LOGICAL_ERROR expectations are death tests
- [ ] #2 ASan lane green for touched suites
- [ ] #3 Docs updated where user-visible (docs/en/antalya/cas) and the spec if the on-S3 format is touched (frozen since 26.6.4: new version + compatibility path)
- [ ] #4 No fallback paths added; failures propagate
<!-- DOD:END -->
