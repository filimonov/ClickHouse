## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
`CasEventType::BlobReuseResurrect` is declared (`CA/Primitives/CasEvent.h:19`, `CasEvent.cpp:21`) but has had no emitter
since blob publication became unconditional after a mandatory HEAD (`907c3b5ce7d`). The `Condemned` publication branch
(`CA/Pool/CasPartWriteTxn.cpp:462`) raises no event or counter at all.
The invariant "revival is a fresh re-upload, never a GET of the condemned object" has unit coverage
(`CASUploadDetached.CondemnedLocalResurrection` and `CondemnedS3Resurrection` in `src/Disks/tests/gtest_cas_upload_detached.cpp`
assert a new etag), but the S16 soak card (`utils/ca-soak/scenarios/cards/s15_s18_shards_lifecycle.py:373-388`) lost its
only direct end-to-end check and now relies on a negative proxy that would miss a revival returning correct bytes.
Giving the existing enum member an emitter on the `Condemned` branch fixes the dead vocabulary and the coverage gap together.
Adding an event is not a protocol step: the HEAD-before-PUT sequence is unchanged (decision-1).

Provenance: BACKLOG/operability-and-introspection.md#blob-reuse-resurrect-no-emitter (S16 soak triage 2026-08-30); verified 2026-09-26 against aefe80eba98 (cas-gc-rebuild) and 0dbbd797792 (altinity/antalya-26.6).

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 A writer that publishes over a condemned blob writes one `cas_log` row with a distinct event type and the new etag
- [ ] #2 S16 asserts that event count is nonzero in its condemned-reuse phase
- [ ] #3 No `CasEventType` member remains without an emitter or an explicit removal
<!-- AC:END -->

## Definition of Done
<!-- DOD:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 CAS* gtest gate green (utils/cas-gate); LOGICAL_ERROR expectations are death tests
- [ ] #2 ASan lane green for touched suites
- [ ] #3 Docs updated where user-visible (docs/en/antalya/cas) and the spec if the on-S3 format is touched (frozen since 26.6.4: new version + compatibility path)
- [ ] #4 No fallback paths added; failures propagate
