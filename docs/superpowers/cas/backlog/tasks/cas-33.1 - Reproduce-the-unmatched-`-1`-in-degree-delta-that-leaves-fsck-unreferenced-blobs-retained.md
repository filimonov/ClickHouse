## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
56 blobs (104,755 bytes) are fsck-unreferenced while GC keeps in-degree 1, flat across 1000+ rounds (2026-07-25).
An unmatched `-1` (owning manifest gone) is a per-key no-op by design and is counted by `CASGCUnmatchedRemoveDeltas`
(`CA/Gc/CasBlobInDegree.cpp:652`). Safety holds (debris, not loss). Open: why the `-1` arrives unmatched. One traced case
is a 43 ms `tmp-fetch_*` publish/drop whose `+1` folded ~3 min later (unverified fold-order-inversion hypothesis).
Needs a targeted repro, not more log reading.

Provenance: BACKLOG/gc.md#fsck-gc-indegree-disagreement-2026-07-25; verified 2026-09-26 against aefe80eba98 (cas-gc-rebuild) and altinity/antalya-26.6.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 A deterministic test reproduces an unmatched `-1` followed by a retained `+1`, or the hypothesis is refuted with evidence
- [ ] #2 If reproduced, a fix proposal names the ordering that must hold between the `+1` and `-1` folds
<!-- AC:END -->

## Definition of Done
<!-- DOD:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 CAS* gtest gate green (utils/cas-gate); LOGICAL_ERROR expectations are death tests
- [ ] #2 ASan lane green for touched suites
- [ ] #3 Docs updated where user-visible (docs/en/antalya/cas) and the spec if the on-S3 format is touched (frozen since 26.6.4: new version + compatibility path)
- [ ] #4 No fallback paths added; failures propagate
