## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
A gtest that dereferences an empty `std::optional` aborts the process; every later test in the binary never runs and the gate reports a
smaller total that still reads green. This hid suites three times in one night.
Measured 2026-09-26: `EXPECT_TRUE(x.has_value())` appears 16 times against 489 `ASSERT_TRUE`; confirmed unguarded sites remain at
`T/gtest_cas_orphan_nomination.cpp:184`, `:188` and, for iterators after `EXPECT_NE(it, end)`, `T/gtest_cas_gc_frontier_gate.cpp:1350`, `:1403`.
In a `void` body `ASSERT_*` is enough; a non-`void` helper must `EXPECT` then bail (`sealedCursorOf`/`holdOf` in `gtest_cas_gc_hold_grammar.cpp`).
A one-off sweep does not close the class; the next test reintroduces it.

Provenance: BACKLOG/testing-and-ci.md#cas-tests-unchecked-optional-deref; counts re-measured 2026-09-26 against 8b87aa15d21.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 A checked accessor in `cas_test_helpers.h` records a test failure and stops the test on an empty value
- [ ] #2 The confirmed sites use it or an `ASSERT_*`, and each remaining `EXPECT_TRUE(x.has_value())` is followed by a guard
- [ ] #3 A deliberately emptied optional in one test leaves the rest of the `CAS*` run executing and counted
<!-- AC:END -->

## Definition of Done
<!-- DOD:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 CAS* gtest gate green (utils/cas-gate); LOGICAL_ERROR expectations are death tests
- [ ] #2 ASan lane green for touched suites
- [ ] #3 Docs updated where user-visible (docs/en/antalya/cas) and the spec if the on-S3 format is touched (frozen since 26.6.4: new version + compatibility path)
- [ ] #4 No fallback paths added; failures propagate
