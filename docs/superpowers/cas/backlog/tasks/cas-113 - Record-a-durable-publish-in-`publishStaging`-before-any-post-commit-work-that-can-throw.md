## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
`CachedPartFolderAccess::promoteBuild` records the commit in an allocation-free region and exposes `commit_recorded`
(`CA/Parts/PartFolderAccess.cpp:297-330`, from `8e6fe6ef0af`), but then runs `eraseView`, which can allocate
(`:277-284`, `recordDecision` `:692`). `ContentAddressedTransaction::publishStaging` calls `promoteBuild` without
`commit_recorded` and assigns `out_slot` only on return (`CA/ContentAddressedTransaction.cpp:473-474`). A
`MEMORY_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` in `eraseView` therefore reports a committed publish as failed. Only allocation failure reaches it.
Fix: extend the no-throw-after-commit rule one frame outward (pass `commit_recorded`, or make `eraseView` non-throwing).

Provenance: BACKLOG/operability-and-introspection.md#partb-review-findings (2026-07-25 publish-confirm review residual); verified 2026-09-26 against dd0ed2f263a and 0dbbd797792.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 A post-commit allocation failure injected via `setPostCommitProbeForTest` leaves `publishStaging`'s `out_slot` set to the committed outcome
- [ ] #2 The other post-commit `eraseView` callers (`dropRef`, `repointRef`) either cannot throw after the commit or are documented as replay-safe
<!-- AC:END -->

## Definition of Done
<!-- DOD:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 CAS* gtest gate green (utils/cas-gate); LOGICAL_ERROR expectations are death tests
- [ ] #2 ASan lane green for touched suites
- [ ] #3 Docs updated where user-visible (docs/en/antalya/cas) and the spec if the on-S3 format is touched (frozen since 26.6.4: new version + compatibility path)
- [ ] #4 No fallback paths added; failures propagate
