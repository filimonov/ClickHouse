## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
`suppress_destructive = anomalies ∨ carried_holds ∨ frontier_incomplete` (`CA/Gc/CasGc.cpp:3203-3204`) and the suppression
is pool-wide by design, because blob in-degree is a pool-wide property (`CA/Gc/CasGc.h:62-64`). `e337bb2c87dc` made an
undecodable `_ckpt` hold only its own namespace, but that hold still closes every destructive site. A long persistent clamp
or one damaged object therefore stops all reclamation until an operator repairs it; bytes grow without bound. Safety is
fail-closed and correct; liveness is unaddressed. The 2026-07-18 S38 starvation shape is moot since `d74c726ef9e3`.
Needs a design: e.g. which delete families are provably independent of the held namespace's edges, or an operator-visible
alarm plus bounded degradation. Narrowing must keep invariant 1 (no delete of a still-named object).

Provenance: BACKLOG/gc.md [clamp liveness] and #ckpt-damage-no-repair-path part (a); verified 2026-09-26 against aefe80eba98 (cas-gc-rebuild) and altinity/antalya-26.6.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 A design note states which delete families, if any, may proceed while one namespace is held, with the safety argument reviewed
- [ ] #2 An operator can see from `system.cas_gc_log` or a metric which namespace has blocked destructive GC and for how many rounds
- [ ] #3 A test with one held namespace shows the agreed behavior for every destructive family
<!-- AC:END -->

## Definition of Done
<!-- DOD:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 CAS* gtest gate green (utils/cas-gate); LOGICAL_ERROR expectations are death tests
- [ ] #2 ASan lane green for touched suites
- [ ] #3 Docs updated where user-visible (docs/en/antalya/cas) and the spec if the on-S3 format is touched (frozen since 26.6.4: new version + compatibility path)
- [ ] #4 No fallback paths added; failures propagate
