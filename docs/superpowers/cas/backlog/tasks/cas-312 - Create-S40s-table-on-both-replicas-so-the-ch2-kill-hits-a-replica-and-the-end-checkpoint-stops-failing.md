## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
S40 is the regression gate for the 2026-07-17 acked-then-lost INSERT (phantom dedup znode under an S3 outage plus a replica kill).
It creates its `ReplicatedMergeTree` only on ch1 (`utils/ca-soak/scenarios/cards/s40_insert_dedup_outage.py:57`), then kills and
restarts ch2, which holds no replica of the table. The shared end checkpoint quiesces every node, so every S40 run records
`quiescence failed` (connection refused in 2026-07; `Table default.s40_dedup_outage does not exist` on ch2 on 2026-08-31 and 2026-09-01)
and skips the quiesced part of the end checkpoint, while the row still reads `pass`.
S39 had the same defect and was fixed by creating the table on every node (`8e39ea2fba4`).

Root cause of the silent pass: `utils/ca-soak/scenarios/checkpoint.py:37` sets `result.add_inconclusive = True`, but `report.py` `finalize()` looks only at `verdicts`, so the flag is never read.

Provenance: utils/ca-soak/scenarios/BACKLOG.md#S40-20260717T090957-1, #S40-20260718T003637-1, #S40-20260719T000359-1; verified 2026-09-26 against 66087be0ffb (cas-gc-rebuild). The quiescence exception path is `framework/checkpoint.py:35-38`.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 S40 creates its table on every node and waits for both replicas before the fault window, or its docstring states why one replica is intended and the end checkpoint is scoped to ch1
- [ ] #2 An S40 run on HEAD records no `quiescence failed` anomaly and its row in `RUN_HISTORY.md` has an empty note
- [ ] #3 A failed quiescence step downgrades the scenario verdict: `checkpoint.py` sets `result.add_inconclusive = True` but `report.py` `finalize()` never reads it, so the run must end as inconclusive (or fail) instead of `pass` when quiescence fails
<!-- AC:END -->

## Definition of Done
<!-- DOD:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 CAS* gtest gate green (utils/cas-gate); LOGICAL_ERROR expectations are death tests
- [ ] #2 ASan lane green for touched suites
- [ ] #3 Docs updated where user-visible (docs/en/antalya/cas) and the spec if the on-S3 format is touched (frozen since 26.6.4: new version + compatibility path)
- [ ] #4 No fallback paths added; failures propagate
