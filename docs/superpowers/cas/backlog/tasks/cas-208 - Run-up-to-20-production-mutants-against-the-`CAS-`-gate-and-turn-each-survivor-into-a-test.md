## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
The request-contract migration rewrote most CAS unit tests. The static vacuity audit (`docs/superpowers/cas/2026-09-03-test-vacuity-audit.md`)
ranked tests DISCRIMINATING / WEAK / TAUTOLOGICAL with a killing mutant each; the dynamic half was never run (deferred by the user 2026-09-03).
A mutant no test kills is a hole in the suite. Procedure: one-line production mutants only, one incremental `build_debug` build and one
`CAS*` run each, revert and check `git status --porcelain -- src` is empty before the next. Cost: ~3-4 hours of a cheap agent, sequential.
An abort in the debug build counts as killed by an assertion.

Provenance: BACKLOG/testing-and-ci.md#cas-unit-test-mutation-battery; verified 2026-09-26 (no battery report exists).

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 A table records each mutant, the tests expected to go red, the actual reds, and KILLED / KILLED-BY-OTHERS / SURVIVED
- [ ] #2 Each SURVIVED mutant has a new test that kills it
- [ ] #3 The report confirms or refutes each TAUTOLOGICAL or WEAK verdict of the static audit, and a final clean `CAS*` gate proves the tree is restored
<!-- AC:END -->

## Definition of Done
<!-- DOD:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 CAS* gtest gate green (utils/cas-gate); LOGICAL_ERROR expectations are death tests
- [ ] #2 ASan lane green for touched suites
- [ ] #3 Docs updated where user-visible (docs/en/antalya/cas) and the spec if the on-S3 format is touched (frozen since 26.6.4: new version + compatibility path)
- [ ] #4 No fallback paths added; failures propagate
