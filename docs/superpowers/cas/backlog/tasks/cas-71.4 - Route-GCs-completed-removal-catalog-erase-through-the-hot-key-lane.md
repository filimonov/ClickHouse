## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
`CasRefCatalog::deleteCompletedRemovingAtSnapshot` writes with `op.replace(layout.refCatalogKey(), ...)` (`R/Pool/CasRefCatalog.cpp:516`), racing the lane and costing it one stale cache entry per erase.
Target: the body from "refresh authority" through the `replace` becomes one `submit` whose `decide` refreshes authority, checks `op.admitted()`, `throwIfAmbiguous` and the exact row. The resolution read after `Committed` stays authoritative.
Prerequisites: the `gc/state` refresh reads through the erase's own operation so the clamp reaches it; the `decide` keeps the absent-catalog refusal; `CompletedRemovingDeleteResult` still needs the catalog cut for `FencedOut`/`EntryChanged`. The operation carries a `Liveness` closure, so it never combines.
The authority gap across the engine's internal reissue (a TTL on the GC lease) stays a separate item.

Provenance: BACKLOG/performance.md#hot-key-lane-phase-b item 4. Verified 2026-09-26 against 59494ebf366 and 0dbbd797792.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 The erase goes through `submit`; `FencedOut` and `EntryChanged` results still carry the catalog cut
- [ ] #2 A gtest interleaving a lane write and a GC erase shows no stale cache entry after the erase
<!-- AC:END -->

## Definition of Done
<!-- DOD:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 CAS* gtest gate green (utils/cas-gate); LOGICAL_ERROR expectations are death tests
- [ ] #2 ASan lane green for touched suites
- [ ] #3 Docs updated where user-visible (docs/en/antalya/cas) and the spec if the on-S3 format is touched (frozen since 26.6.4: new version + compatibility path)
- [ ] #4 No fallback paths added; failures propagate
