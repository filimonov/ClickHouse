## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
No changelog line exists for CAS: `CHANGELOG.md` and `docs/changelogs/` have zero hits for content-addressed or antalya. `CHANGELOG.md`
is assembled from PR "Changelog entry" fields, so the fix is a "New Feature" entry in the CAS PR description plus the Antalya
release notes, not a hand edit. Behavior changes an upgrading user can hit and must be told about:
- `clickhouse-disks --query` now exits with the failing command's code (carve-out is CAS-61; no changelog line yet).
- the `lazy_load_tables` `SYSTEM`-command behavior change (written up nowhere).
- `cas_log` and `cas_gc_log` ship enabled by default (`programs/server/config.xml:1201,1321`).
- unknown CAS config keys are now rejected (`73f49694b37`).
- on `gcs_hmac`, every request is GOOG4-signed and `x-amz-*` headers are handled strictly (`fable-review-triage.md` M-item, point 2).

Provenance: BACKLOG/docs-and-cleanup.md#cas-changelog-entry-missing (from final-checks-todo.md item 12b) and [CHANGELOG-unknown-config-key-rejection]. Verified 2026-09-26 against 6eb16e1cc56.

## Definition of Done
<!-- DOD:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 CAS* gtest gate green (utils/cas-gate); LOGICAL_ERROR expectations are death tests
- [ ] #2 ASan lane green for touched suites
- [ ] #3 Docs updated where user-visible (docs/en/antalya/cas) and the spec if the on-S3 format is touched (frozen since 26.6.4: new version + compatibility path)
- [ ] #4 No fallback paths added; failures propagate
