## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Roadmap §1 blocks the first deployment on "migration tested at scale in both directions"; §7 lists "Migration at scale" open.
`docs/en/antalya/cas/operations/migration.md` documents `ALTER TABLE ... MOVE PARTITION` onto CAS and rollback, but no run at
realistic size exists. `MOVE PARTITION` to a CAS disk re-packs every part, so its request count, duration and GC load on the
pool are unknown at scale. The mixed-version rollout half of the source item moved to `format-version-rollout-design`.

Provenance: BACKLOG/operability-and-introspection.md#b13-migration-path ([B13]); verified 2026-09-26 against dd0ed2f263a.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 A recorded run moves at least one multi-TB table onto CAS and back, with duration, S3 request counts and GC round times
- [ ] #2 Row counts and checksums match before and after each direction, and fsck is clean
- [ ] #3 `migration.md` states the measured throughput and any limits found
<!-- AC:END -->

## Definition of Done
<!-- DOD:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 CAS* gtest gate green (utils/cas-gate); LOGICAL_ERROR expectations are death tests
- [ ] #2 ASan lane green for touched suites
- [ ] #3 Docs updated where user-visible (docs/en/antalya/cas) and the spec if the on-S3 format is touched (frozen since 26.6.4: new version + compatibility path)
- [ ] #4 No fallback paths added; failures propagate
