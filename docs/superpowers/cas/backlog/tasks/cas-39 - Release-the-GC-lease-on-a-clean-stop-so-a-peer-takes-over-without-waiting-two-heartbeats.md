## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
`GcScheduler::stop` joins the workers and clears the in-process leader hint but leaves the durable `gc/state` lease
untouched (`CA/Gc/CasGcScheduler.h:122-126`). A peer then waits about two heartbeat ticks (~2×`gc_interval_sec`, default
60 s) before stealing. No correctness risk. The roadmap's "Clean shutdown" item asks that a restart cost no lost GC
round. Proposal: a "resign" write mirroring the mount side's farewell. A new protocol step: owner consult first.

Provenance: BACKLOG/gc.md#gc-lease-not-released-on-clean-stop (CAS-099); verified 2026-09-26 against aefe80eba98 (cas-gc-rebuild) and altinity/antalya-26.6.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 The owner approves or rejects the resign write
- [ ] #2 If approved, a test shows a peer acquires the lease on its next round after a clean stop, and a crash still needs the observation window
<!-- AC:END -->

## Definition of Done
<!-- DOD:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 CAS* gtest gate green (utils/cas-gate); LOGICAL_ERROR expectations are death tests
- [ ] #2 ASan lane green for touched suites
- [ ] #3 Docs updated where user-visible (docs/en/antalya/cas) and the spec if the on-S3 format is touched (frozen since 26.6.4: new version + compatibility path)
- [ ] #4 No fallback paths added; failures propagate
<!-- DOD:END -->
