## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
`05e7fc2bdee` (cas-gc-rebuild) recommends `http_keep_alive_timeout = 30` and `http_keep_alive_max_requests = 10000` on every CAS S3 disk: in `docs/en/antalya/cas/configuration.md`, in the stateless-lane CAS storage policy and in every `test_cas_*` disk config. It is not on `altinity/antalya-26.6`.
With the generic S3 default of 100 requests per connection, a connection is torn down every ~100 CAS requests and its port cycles through `TIME_WAIT`; under sustained load that exhausts ephemeral ports and starves the mount-lease renewal (commit message of `05e7fc2bdee`, issue #2243). Audit F27 measured one new TLS connection per ~98 requests, 109k per day, on the otel.demo stand.
The recommendation is operator config, not a code default; CAS-74 decides whether it becomes one.

Provenance: BACKLOG.md#inbox [cas-keep-alive-recommendation-backport], queued by the u11-specs-c grooming unit; verified 2026-09-26: `05e7fc2bdee` is not an ancestor of altinity/antalya-26.6.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 The docs section and the disk-config changes of `05e7fc2bdee` (or an equivalent) are on altinity/antalya-26.6
- [ ] #2 Every S3-backed CAS disk definition in the test and stateless-lane configs of altinity/antalya-26.6 sets both settings
<!-- AC:END -->

## Definition of Done
<!-- DOD:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 CAS* gtest gate green (utils/cas-gate); LOGICAL_ERROR expectations are death tests
- [ ] #2 ASan lane green for touched suites
- [ ] #3 Docs updated where user-visible (docs/en/antalya/cas) and the spec if the on-S3 format is touched (frozen since 26.6.4: new version + compatibility path)
- [ ] #4 No fallback paths added; failures propagate
<!-- DOD:END -->
