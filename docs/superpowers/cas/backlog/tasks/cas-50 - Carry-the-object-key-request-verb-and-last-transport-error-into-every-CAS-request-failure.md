## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
When a CAS request fails, the operator sees no cause. Two sites lose it:
- The retry loops classify each transport failure and log nothing: `CasOperation::observe` and `observePresence`
  (`CA/Backend/CasRequests.cpp:753-793`) and the write-attempt catch (`:945-1005`). `GaveUp` (`CA/Backend/CasWriteResult.h:60-70`)
  carries no error text, so the give-up message (`:499`, via `throwCasWriteRetryLater`) names only the deadline and the attempt count.
  A lane that wedges after `max_attempts` never names the socket error, timeout or S3 code that caused it.
- Under the single-attempt control plane (every writable Native mount, `CA/ContentAddressedMetadataStorage.cpp:819-823`) the read loop
  rethrows the raw transport exception (`CA/Backend/CasRequests.h:490-491`). A transient failure on the catalog, `_ckpt` or `gc/state`
  reaches the query as a bare `S3_ERROR` with no key and no operation.
Deterministic local failures are already rethrown (`isDeterministicLocalFailure`), so this is diagnosis only; every exit stays fail-closed.
Shape: record the last attempt's exception text in the loop state, put it into the give-up message, annotate an escaping exception
with verb and key, and add a rate-limited log at classification (`logCasWriteRetryLater`, `:85-94`, is the existing limiter).

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 A CAS write or read that gives up after retries produces an error message naming the key, the verb and the last attempt's transport error
- [ ] #2 A single-attempt control-object failure that reaches a query names the object key and the operation
- [ ] #3 Per-attempt transport failures are logged through a rate limiter, and a test shows the rate limit holds under a retry storm
- [ ] #4 No error code or retry decision changes: existing request-engine tests pass unchanged
<!-- AC:END -->

## Definition of Done
<!-- DOD:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 CAS* gtest gate green (utils/cas-gate); LOGICAL_ERROR expectations are death tests
- [ ] #2 ASan lane green for touched suites
- [ ] #3 Docs updated where user-visible (docs/en/antalya/cas) and the spec if the on-S3 format is touched (frozen since 26.6.4: new version + compatibility path)
- [ ] #4 No fallback paths added; failures propagate
