## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
`Gc::previewDeletes` (`CA/Gc/CasGc.cpp:4608`) stores the raw HEAD size, header included, for zero-in-degree candidates
(`:4645`) but the payload-only stored size for retired-in-snapshot rows (`:4671`, written through `retiredLogicalSize`,
`:286`). `clickhouse-disks cas-gc-dryrun` prints the column raw (`programs/disks/CommandCaGcDryRun.cpp:47`), so a sum
mixes units by `blob_header_len` (256 by default) per condemned row. Diagnostic-only command; one-line fix.

Provenance: BACKLOG/operability-and-introspection.md#byte-accounting-blobs-only-and-preview-size-units second half (2031-triage CAS-123); verified 2026-09-26 against aefe80eba98 (cas-gc-rebuild) and 0dbbd797792 (altinity/antalya-26.6).
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Every `PreviewEntry::size` uses the same unit, or both physical and logical sizes are carried
- [ ] #2 A test with one candidate of each kind checks the sizes agree in unit
<!-- AC:END -->

## Definition of Done
<!-- DOD:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 CAS* gtest gate green (utils/cas-gate); LOGICAL_ERROR expectations are death tests
- [ ] #2 ASan lane green for touched suites
- [ ] #3 Docs updated where user-visible (docs/en/antalya/cas) and the spec if the on-S3 format is touched (frozen since 26.6.4: new version + compatibility path)
- [ ] #4 No fallback paths added; failures propagate
<!-- DOD:END -->
