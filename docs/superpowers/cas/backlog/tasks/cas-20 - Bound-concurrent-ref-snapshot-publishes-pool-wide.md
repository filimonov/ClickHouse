## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
The single-in-flight gate on background snapshot publishes is per table: `CasRefLedger::admitSnapshotPublishUnderStateLock` (`R/Pool/CasRefLedger.cpp:4140`) checks `pending_snapshot_publishes == 0` on one runtime. Each admitted publish spawns a detached `ThreadFromGlobalPool` (`Pool::tryDispatchDetached`, `R/Pool/CasPool.cpp:1038`).
An ingest wave crossing the trigger (256 log entries / 1 MiB) on N tables starts N concurrent whole-namespace re-encodes at once. Fail-soft (retried on the next trigger, per-table backoff), not a correctness item.
A claimed pending-count leak here does not exist (closed by `829ad698ef6`).

Provenance: BACKLOG/performance.md#snapshot-publish-fanout-unbounded (2031-triage CAS-051). Verified 2026-09-26 against aefe80eba98 and 0dbbd797792.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 A pool-wide limiter under the per-table gate caps concurrent snapshot publishes at a configured number
- [ ] #2 A gtest with N tables over threshold observes at most the cap in flight and all tables eventually published
<!-- AC:END -->

## Definition of Done
<!-- DOD:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 CAS* gtest gate green (utils/cas-gate); LOGICAL_ERROR expectations are death tests
- [ ] #2 ASan lane green for touched suites
- [ ] #3 Docs updated where user-visible (docs/en/antalya/cas) and the spec if the on-S3 format is touched (frozen since 26.6.4: new version + compatibility path)
- [ ] #4 No fallback paths added; failures propagate
