## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
GCS soak `ca_live_20260904_r2`: a `both pause` of 29 s against a 30 s lease TTL fenced `ch2`; its ref lane went `CASRefNeedsRecovery`, then
remounted normally. The data model matched byte for byte and fsck was clean, yet the checkpoint aborted the driver as a "LATE-PUT FENCING VIOLATION".
`PAUSE` draws 5-60 s (`utils/ca-soak/soak/chaos.py:16`) against a 30 s TTL, and `CASRefNeedsRecovery` is a cumulative must-stay-zero counter
(`soak/signals.py:94`, gate at `soak/run.py:871`), so one correct recovery keeps it nonzero forever.
Options: classify a pause within 1 s of the TTL, or longer, as `freeze_long`; or exempt the counter when the lane has since remounted and the model matches.

Provenance: BACKLOG/testing-and-ci.md#soak-harness-needsrecovery-after-near-ttl-pause; verified 2026-09-26 against 8b87aa15d21 (harness is not on antalya-26.6). Not a duplicate of CAS-162.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 A pause at or beyond the lease TTL minus 1 s is scheduled or scored as `freeze_long`
- [ ] #2 A recovery that ends in a remount with a matching model does not fail the checkpoint; a lane still in `NeedsRecovery` does
<!-- AC:END -->

## Definition of Done
<!-- DOD:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 CAS* gtest gate green (utils/cas-gate); LOGICAL_ERROR expectations are death tests
- [ ] #2 ASan lane green for touched suites
- [ ] #3 Docs updated where user-visible (docs/en/antalya/cas) and the spec if the on-S3 format is touched (frozen since 26.6.4: new version + compatibility path)
- [ ] #4 No fallback paths added; failures propagate
