## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
The ref lane is the canary's insert bottleneck: lane ~100% busy, 748 ms of an 887 ms insert is queue wait, 3.1 mutations per flush
in steady state and up to 34 in removal bursts, at most ~5 flushes per second (audit section 1, F25).
The lane is a leader/follower group commit with no delay: the leader carves every pending item at once
(`CA/Pool/CasRefLedger.cpp:2059` `appendRefOpsOnRuntime`, `:2753` `flushRefBatch`). Each flush costs one `_log` PUT and one `_ckpt` PUT.
A delay-and-combine window of a few milliseconds may raise mutations per flush and cut PUTs, at the cost of latency when the lane is idle.
Measure after CAS-176 (flush from four round trips to two) and CAS-83 (no repoint), which change the flush cost this depends on.

Provenance: umbrella-roadmap.md section 2 bullet 'Ref-lane batching'; filed 2026-09-26 (user decision). Verified 2026-09-26 against c16a2589f56 (cas-gc-rebuild) and 8d62c314ec1 (altinity/antalya-26.6).

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 A soak or stand run records mutations per flush, flushes per second and insert lane wait with no window and with at least two window sizes
- [ ] #2 The result states whether a window lowers p50 and p99 insert latency and PUTs per part, and the recommendation is recorded in the task
- [ ] #3 If the window helps, a follow-up task with the chosen size is filed; if not, the task closes with the numbers
<!-- AC:END -->

## Definition of Done
<!-- DOD:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 CAS* gtest gate green (utils/cas-gate); LOGICAL_ERROR expectations are death tests
- [ ] #2 ASan lane green for touched suites
- [ ] #3 Docs updated where user-visible (docs/en/antalya/cas) and the spec if the on-S3 format is touched (frozen since 26.6.4: new version + compatibility path)
- [ ] #4 No fallback paths added; failures propagate
