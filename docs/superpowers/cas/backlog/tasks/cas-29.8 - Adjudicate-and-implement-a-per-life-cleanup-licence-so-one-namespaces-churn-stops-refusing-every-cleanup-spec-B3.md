## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
The whole-catalog etag equality in `authorityHolds` licenses irreversible deletes; its comment calls the strictness deliberate
("the SAME complete catalog observation and GC lease that adopted the fold"). After B2 the cleanup no longer uses the fold-time
listing: its inputs are a catalog cut, the adopted `gc/state` and the life's own checkpoint.
Hypothesis to adjudicate, not to assume: the cleanup takes its own fresh catalog cut at phase start; each chunk is licensed by
row value, life resolution (`throwIfAmbiguous`) and `gc/state` owner + `seq`; a refusal is scoped to its namespace and the pass
continues. It is also the only licence shape that survives multi-node execution.
Rejected: relaxing the etag check directly. Constraints: the round stays one-pass, LIST trust is not reopened (decision-2),
no new object kinds (decision-4). Process: ca-arch with the code, then codex review capped at three rounds, then code.
Proceed only if the measurement subtask shows etag-only refusals dominate.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 A written adjudication answers whether the fold seal or this life's coverage depends on the rest of the cut, reviewed to no MAJOR
- [ ] #2 A CREATE of an unrelated table between fold and cleanup no longer refuses the pass
- [ ] #3 A changed row or life of the cleaned namespace refuses that namespace only; a moved `gc/state` owner or seq refuses everything
- [ ] #4 On the ca-s3 lane, refusals whose row and life were unchanged are zero
<!-- AC:END -->

## Definition of Done
<!-- DOD:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 CAS* gtest gate green (utils/cas-gate); LOGICAL_ERROR expectations are death tests
- [ ] #2 ASan lane green for touched suites
- [ ] #3 Docs updated where user-visible (docs/en/antalya/cas) and the spec if the on-S3 format is touched (frozen since 26.6.4: new version + compatibility path)
- [ ] #4 No fallback paths added; failures propagate
