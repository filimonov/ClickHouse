## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
`ref_catalog` is one pool-global object mutated on every CREATE/DROP; phase B is the roadmap's answer to the remaining write hotspot (issue #2343). Designed to spec revision 26 (`26bde9f9604`), deferred by owner on 2026-09-04, not started.
Phase A fixed the seams so no sub-item reopens callers: `submit`'s signature, `Decide = DecideOnObject`, the engine `WriteResult`, the caller's `Conflict` loop, the queue with the guard as sole remover.
Each subtask has its own gate; none starts on the documentation's say-so.
Rules for the next design round (26 revisions in one day, findings never below eight per round): a review revision only removes or tightens; a new feature costs its own revision; prose slips are MINOR; after three rounds the remaining questions are answered by code and tests.

Provenance: BACKLOG/performance.md#hot-key-lane-phase-b; roadmap §2 'Catalog write hotspot'. Verified 2026-09-26 against 59494ebf366 and 0dbbd797792.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Each subtask is either Done or closed with its gate's measured no-go recorded
<!-- AC:END -->

## Definition of Done
<!-- DOD:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 CAS* gtest gate green (utils/cas-gate); LOGICAL_ERROR expectations are death tests
- [ ] #2 ASan lane green for touched suites
- [ ] #3 Docs updated where user-visible (docs/en/antalya/cas) and the spec if the on-S3 format is touched (frozen since 26.6.4: new version + compatibility path)
- [ ] #4 No fallback paths added; failures propagate
