## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
`listRefPrefix` is one LIST of `<prefix>/cas/ns/stream/`, O(all `_log` keys). On otel.demo that is 4.6M keys, ~1575 s and
~1.2 GiB resident per round (audit F19); earlier it was 79% of GC wall time (2026-08), the audit re-measures 30-42%.
The S3 async iterator also schedules one global-pool job per page, ~1,500 short-lived threads per round (audit F24).
B1: take `Live`/`Removing` lives from the catalog cut, issue one exact GET of `refLogKey(life, last_folded + 1)` per life
on the round's io pool (404 = quiet), and LIST only a hot life's stream from `start-after` = its covered floor.
`shouldDeferRound` is decided from the probes. LIST is not consulted for the verdict, so decision-2 is untouched.
Before reusing the LIST path, confirm `max_keys` propagation into `S3ObjectStorage::iterate` (audit F6: ~3 requests per
1000-key page).

Provenance: BACKLOG/gc.md#gc-defer-decision-list-cost and [gc-frontier-one-list]; verified 2026-09-26 against aefe80eba98 (cas-gc-rebuild) and altinity/antalya-26.6: global LIST still in place on both.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 A pool with K live lives and M `_log` keys below every floor: `defer_decision` issues exactly K exact GETs and no LIST when nothing changed
- [ ] #2 A hot life costs one LIST page starting at its floor; the DEFER verdict and `ref_tables` equal the global-LIST oracle's for the same state
- [ ] #3 A `_log` key above the floor omitted by an injected LIST omission still folds; a key below the floor is never touched
- [ ] #4 On otel.demo `defer_decision` wall time no longer grows with `_log` keys below the floor of quiet lives
<!-- AC:END -->

## Definition of Done
<!-- DOD:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 CAS* gtest gate green (utils/cas-gate); LOGICAL_ERROR expectations are death tests
- [ ] #2 ASan lane green for touched suites
- [ ] #3 Docs updated where user-visible (docs/en/antalya/cas) and the spec if the on-S3 format is touched (frozen since 26.6.4: new version + compatibility path)
- [ ] #4 No fallback paths added; failures propagate
