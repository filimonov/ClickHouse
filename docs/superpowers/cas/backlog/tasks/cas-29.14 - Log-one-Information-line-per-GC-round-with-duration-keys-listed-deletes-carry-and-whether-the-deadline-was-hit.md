## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
At the default `Information` level a CAS node logs no GC round at all: the scheduler logs a round only when teardown
stops it or another leader blocks it, and the fold has two `LOG_INFO` sites for rare paths. Of 73 log sites in `Gc/`
and `Pool/`, 12 are Info. Everything the otel.demo audit found came from `cas_gc_log`, `cas_log`, `metric_log` and
`trace_log`, none from the text log (audit F28). The audit calls one Info line per round the cheapest observability win.
Fields: round, outcome, duration, keys listed, deleted, carried, `deadline_hit` (the last two exist once
u02-gc-b:gc-c1-round-deadline-and-pacing lands; log what exists and add them with it).

Provenance: BACKLOG/gc.md#otel-demo-s3-budget-audit-2026-09-25 (F28, one of the nine findings not threaded elsewhere). Parented on the epic per the u01 cross-unit note (spec C5 observability). Verified 2026-09-26 against d4be7f7045a and 0dbbd797792.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Every finished or aborted round emits exactly one `LOG_INFO` line from the scheduler with the fields above
- [ ] #2 A gtest or stateless test captures the line for a `GC RUN` and checks its round number matches `cas_gc_log`
<!-- AC:END -->

## Definition of Done
<!-- DOD:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 CAS* gtest gate green (utils/cas-gate); LOGICAL_ERROR expectations are death tests
- [ ] #2 ASan lane green for touched suites
- [ ] #3 Docs updated where user-visible (docs/en/antalya/cas) and the spec if the on-S3 format is touched (frozen since 26.6.4: new version + compatibility path)
- [ ] #4 No fallback paths added; failures propagate
