## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Cross-node GC has no fence for a reader that holds no ref (R1/X1 ephemeral reader pin). For normal MergeTree this is covered: namespaces are per-server, `DataPart` lifetime holds the ref, and a live ref resolving to an absent object surfaces `FILE_DOESNT_EXIST` (INV-NO-DANGLE).
Before designing a pin, enumerate the read paths and show whether a ref-less reader exists at all (backup, `clickhouse-disks`, cross-node relink fetch are the candidates).

Provenance: BACKLOG/performance.md#read-write [R1/X1]. Verified 2026-09-26 against aefe80eba98 and 0dbbd797792.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 A written enumeration of every CA read entry point states which ref pins it
- [ ] #2 Either no ref-less reader exists (item closed with the enumeration) or a concrete path and a design task are filed
<!-- AC:END -->

## Definition of Done
<!-- DOD:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 CAS* gtest gate green (utils/cas-gate); LOGICAL_ERROR expectations are death tests
- [ ] #2 ASan lane green for touched suites
- [ ] #3 Docs updated where user-visible (docs/en/antalya/cas) and the spec if the on-S3 format is touched (frozen since 26.6.4: new version + compatibility path)
- [ ] #4 No fallback paths added; failures propagate
<!-- DOD:END -->
