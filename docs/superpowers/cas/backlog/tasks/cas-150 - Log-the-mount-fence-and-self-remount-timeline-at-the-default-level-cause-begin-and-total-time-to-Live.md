## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
An operator cannot reconstruct a lease-loss episode from the server log. What exists: the renewal outcome
(`deliverMountRenewObservability`, `CA/Pool/CasServerRoot.cpp:336`, Warning "fenced after N attempts") and one line per remount
attempt with its step (`CA/Pool/CasPool.cpp:1283-1297`). Missing: a line when the local fence arms (with the cause: renewal
budget, GC fence-out, foreign interference), a remount-begin line, and a remount-complete line with the total fence-to-Live
duration. Physical renewal retries are Debug only (`CasServerRoot.cpp:350-356`).
Evidence: a 7-minute msan CA-s3 fence window (run `07f8398acddff2c`) held zero lease lines; on the canary the audit found no
renewal retries at the default level (F28), and issue #2421 dropped the lease there. The real-GCS soak (2026-09-04) lost the
lease to a DNS outage that the remount log did not name as DNS.
The totals are the measurement the blast-radius design question waits for.

Provenance: BACKLOG/mounts-and-lifecycle.md#mount-fence [fence-window observability], plus the DNS-naming ask of #remount-backoff-no-jitter and the measurement step of [fence-window blast radius]; verified 2026-09-26 against b1c34d03479 (cas-gc-rebuild) and 0dbbd797792 (altinity/antalya-26.6).

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 A lease-loss episode logs, at Information or above, fence armed with its cause, remount begun, and remount complete with the total fence-to-Live time
- [ ] #2 A remount attempt that fails on name resolution says so in its failure line
- [ ] #3 A test forces a fence and a remount and asserts the three lines appear in order
<!-- AC:END -->

## Definition of Done
<!-- DOD:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 CAS* gtest gate green (utils/cas-gate); LOGICAL_ERROR expectations are death tests
- [ ] #2 ASan lane green for touched suites
- [ ] #3 Docs updated where user-visible (docs/en/antalya/cas) and the spec if the on-S3 format is touched (frozen since 26.6.4: new version + compatibility path)
- [ ] #4 No fallback paths added; failures propagate
