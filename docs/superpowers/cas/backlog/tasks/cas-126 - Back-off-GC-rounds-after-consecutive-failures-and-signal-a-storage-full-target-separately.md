## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
After a failed round the scheduler waits the plain `interval` and retries forever (`CA/Gc/CasGcScheduler.cpp:303`, catch
after `:390`); the only backoff counts follower ticks (`:377-386`). No ProfileEvent separates a full or quota-limited target
from generic instability. Spec stage C adds back-to-back rounds while catching up, which makes an unbounded retry of a failing
round more costly.

Provenance: BACKLOG/operability-and-introspection.md#disk-error-audit-followups-2026-07-21 (DESIRABLE GC backoff); verified 2026-09-26 against dd0ed2f263a and 0dbbd797792.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Consecutive failed rounds wait with capped exponential backoff, reset on success
- [ ] #2 A distinct ProfileEvent or `cas_gc_log` outcome marks rounds failed by a storage-full or quota error
<!-- AC:END -->

## Definition of Done
<!-- DOD:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 CAS* gtest gate green (utils/cas-gate); LOGICAL_ERROR expectations are death tests
- [ ] #2 ASan lane green for touched suites
- [ ] #3 Docs updated where user-visible (docs/en/antalya/cas) and the spec if the on-S3 format is touched (frozen since 26.6.4: new version + compatibility path)
- [ ] #4 No fallback paths added; failures propagate
