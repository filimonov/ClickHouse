## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Issue #2332: concurrent `SELECT FINAL` over compact parts resets S3 connections, exhausts ephemeral ports and costs the mount lease with no store outage. The read stops mid-granule with up to `remote_read_min_bytes_for_seek` = 4 MiB left in the requested range, so the connection cannot be reused. The same happens on plain S3.
The drain-remainder patch (branch `fix/antalya-26.6/s3-drain-buffered-remainder`) recovers at most ~7.8 KiB, and 0 bytes once any body read happened; research ranks it third.
Ranked first: do not create the remainder. Bound the range via `MergeTreeReaderStream::adjustRightMark` (`src/Storages/MergeTree/MergeTreeReaderStream.cpp:246`) and its `setReadUntilPosition` call (`:270`) feeding `ReadBufferFromS3::setReadUntilPosition` (`src/IO/ReadBufferFromS3.cpp:500`). Upstream-portable, no vendored Poco change.
First step: measure where the over-long ranges come from on the 229-part repro (`DiskConnectionsReset` per query).

Provenance: BACKLOG/performance.md#s3-drain-remainder-read-range-fix. Verified 2026-09-26 against 59494ebf366 and 0dbbd797792.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 On the #2332 repro, `DiskConnectionsReset` per query drops to near zero with the fix, with query results unchanged
- [ ] #2 A stateless test or gtest pins the range end at the granule boundary for a column-subset read of a compact part
- [ ] #3 The patch is shaped as an upstream PR (motivation outside CAS stated)
<!-- AC:END -->

## Definition of Done
<!-- DOD:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 CAS* gtest gate green (utils/cas-gate); LOGICAL_ERROR expectations are death tests
- [ ] #2 ASan lane green for touched suites
- [ ] #3 Docs updated where user-visible (docs/en/antalya/cas) and the spec if the on-S3 format is touched (frozen since 26.6.4: new version + compatibility path)
- [ ] #4 No fallback paths added; failures propagate
<!-- DOD:END -->
