## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Every other GC budget reads `0` as unbounded; `gc_frontier_probe_budget` reads `0` as "probe nothing", and one unprobed
namespace suppresses all destruction for the round. The default is spelled `std::numeric_limits<uint64_t>::max()`
(`CA/Pool/CasPool.h:155`) because tests drive the exhaustion path with `0`. An operator who sets `0` by analogy
stops GC deletes permanently, and a finite value that fits ten namespaces becomes a GC stop for a larger pool.
Spec C2 leaves this budget out of scope. Revisit after B1, which replaces the frontier probes' role in discovery.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 The setting has one documented unbounded spelling consistent with the other budgets, and tests reach exhaustion another way
- [ ] #2 A configured value that suppresses deletes logs a Warning naming the setting
<!-- AC:END -->

## Definition of Done
<!-- DOD:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 CAS* gtest gate green (utils/cas-gate); LOGICAL_ERROR expectations are death tests
- [ ] #2 ASan lane green for touched suites
- [ ] #3 Docs updated where user-visible (docs/en/antalya/cas) and the spec if the on-S3 format is touched (frozen since 26.6.4: new version + compatibility path)
- [ ] #4 No fallback paths added; failures propagate
