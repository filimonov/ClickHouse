## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Every state-growing ref op is previewed by `admits` (`CA/Pool/CasRefProtocol.cpp:718-736`) against the snapshot and removal
budgets (`CA/Pool/CasRefLedger.cpp:1291`) and refused with `LIMIT_EXCEEDED` (`:3193`). At 75-95 bytes per snapshot row the
ceiling is 0.6-0.9 M refs per table. A merge grows before it shrinks, so a table at the ceiling cannot merge its way down; only
removals help. Reaching it needs `max_parts_in_total` raised several-fold plus outdated parts holding refs.
Nothing reports consumption today, so the first signal is a refused INSERT.

Provenance: BACKLOG/formats-and-storage.md#ref-table-64mib-admission-ceiling part (a) (2031-triage CAS-111); verified 2026-09-26 against 8b87aa15d21 (cas-gc-rebuild) and 8d62c314ec1 (altinity/antalya-26.6).

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 A system table or metric shows each table's snapshot and removal budget use in bytes
- [ ] #2 A WARNING is logged, rate-limited, when a table passes a documented fraction of the budget
- [ ] #3 The operator docs name the ceiling and how to get below it
<!-- AC:END -->

## Definition of Done
<!-- DOD:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 CAS* gtest gate green (utils/cas-gate); LOGICAL_ERROR expectations are death tests
- [ ] #2 ASan lane green for touched suites
- [ ] #3 Docs updated where user-visible (docs/en/antalya/cas) and the spec if the on-S3 format is touched (frozen since 26.6.4: new version + compatibility path)
- [ ] #4 No fallback paths added; failures propagate
