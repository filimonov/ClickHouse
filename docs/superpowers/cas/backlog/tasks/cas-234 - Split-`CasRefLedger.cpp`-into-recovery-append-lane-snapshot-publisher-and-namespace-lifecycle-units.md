## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
`CA/Pool/CasRefLedger.cpp` is 5353 lines, the largest CA file. Roadmap §5: split into recovery/cache, append lane and wedge
protocol, snapshot publisher, namespace lifecycle, and a thin facade, by moving code, not rewriting it.
The ledger is the ref-safety core, so equivalence fences go in first.

Provenance: BACKLOG/docs-and-cleanup.md#refactor-candidates-from-defects item 3 (CasRefLedger half) and roadmap §5; verified 2026-09-26 against 6eb16e1cc56 and 8d62c314ec1.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Equivalence tests for recovery, append and snapshot publication exist and pass before any code moves
- [ ] #2 `CasRefLedger` is a facade over the four units, and no protocol step or on-S3 format changes
- [ ] #3 The `CAS*` gtest gate and the ASan lane are green on the committed tree after the move
<!-- AC:END -->

## Definition of Done
<!-- DOD:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 CAS* gtest gate green (utils/cas-gate); LOGICAL_ERROR expectations are death tests
- [ ] #2 ASan lane green for touched suites
- [ ] #3 Docs updated where user-visible (docs/en/antalya/cas) and the spec if the on-S3 format is touched (frozen since 26.6.4: new version + compatibility path)
- [ ] #4 No fallback paths added; failures propagate
<!-- DOD:END -->
