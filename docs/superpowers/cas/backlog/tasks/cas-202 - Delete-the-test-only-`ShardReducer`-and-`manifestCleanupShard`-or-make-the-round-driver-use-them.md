## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
`ShardReducer` and `manifestCleanupShard` (`CA/Gc/CasGcShardPlan.h:58`, `:62`) have no production caller on either branch.
The live sharded fold buckets by `blobShard` and calls `foldDeltasIntoGeneration` directly (`CA/Gc/CasGc.cpp:3328`, `:3372`, `:4319`);
`CasGc.cpp:3343` names `ShardReducer` only in a comment. Tests of the dead API prove nothing about the running fold.
`manifestCleanupShard` is the only routing function for the part-manifest cleanup axis, so deleting it must be a stated decision.

Provenance: BACKLOG/testing-and-ci.md#shard-reduce-api-production-dead; verified 2026-09-26 against 8b87aa15d21 and 8d62c314ec1.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Either the API is gone and its tests target `foldDeltasIntoGeneration` and the live bucketing, or the round driver constructs one reducer per shard
- [ ] #2 The decision about the manifest-cleanup routing function is recorded in the commit message
- [ ] #3 `CAS*` gate green
<!-- AC:END -->

## Definition of Done
<!-- DOD:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 CAS* gtest gate green (utils/cas-gate); LOGICAL_ERROR expectations are death tests
- [ ] #2 ASan lane green for touched suites
- [ ] #3 Docs updated where user-visible (docs/en/antalya/cas) and the spec if the on-S3 format is touched (frozen since 26.6.4: new version + compatibility path)
- [ ] #4 No fallback paths added; failures propagate
<!-- DOD:END -->
