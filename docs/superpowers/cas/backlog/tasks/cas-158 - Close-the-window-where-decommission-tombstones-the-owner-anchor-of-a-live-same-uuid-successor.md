## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Between decommission's liveness recheck (the `mount`/`epoch` GETs) and the owner-anchor CAS, a live same-uuid successor can
recreate itself; its owner anchor is then tombstoned, and its next restart is refused with `CORRUPTED_DATA`. Availability,
not data loss: the successor's process keeps running. Accepted explicitly in code ("ACCEPTED RESIDUAL WINDOW",
`CA/Tools/CasDecommission.cpp:419-427`). The older framing "the sweep deletes what the successor needs" was wrong: the
destructive phases run under the victim's own mount lease.
Reproducing it needs a chaos test that restarts the victim between the recheck and the CAS.

Provenance: BACKLOG/mounts-and-lifecycle.md#decommission-toctou-stamps-successor (was [decommission-successor-mount-race], 2026-08-04 triage finding 9); verified 2026-09-26 against b1c34d03479 (cas-gc-rebuild) and 0dbbd797792 (altinity/antalya-26.6).

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 A test that restarts the victim inside the window either shows the successor still restartable or fails on the current code
- [ ] #2 The accepted-residual comment is removed or narrowed to what remains
<!-- AC:END -->

## Definition of Done
<!-- DOD:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 CAS* gtest gate green (utils/cas-gate); LOGICAL_ERROR expectations are death tests
- [ ] #2 ASan lane green for touched suites
- [ ] #3 Docs updated where user-visible (docs/en/antalya/cas) and the spec if the on-S3 format is touched (frozen since 26.6.4: new version + compatibility path)
- [ ] #4 No fallback paths added; failures propagate
