## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Pool identity stays `pool_id`-based (endpoint matching is rejected as unsafe, `ContentAddressedExchange.h:157`). An advisory
endpoint in the mount lease would let a mount report that the same pool is being mounted from another endpoint, the signature
of a replicated prefix. The lease body is on-S3 format, frozen since `26.6.4.20001.altinityantalya` (decision-4): any field
needs a new format version and a compatibility path.

Provenance: BACKLOG/docs-and-cleanup.md#pool-exclusive-prefix-undocumented (the 'Optional' sentence); decision-4 applies. Verified 2026-09-26 against 6eb16e1cc56.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 A decision records whether the advisory field is worth a format version, given the docs rule of `bucket-requirements-docs`
<!-- AC:END -->

## Definition of Done
<!-- DOD:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 CAS* gtest gate green (utils/cas-gate); LOGICAL_ERROR expectations are death tests
- [ ] #2 ASan lane green for touched suites
- [ ] #3 Docs updated where user-visible (docs/en/antalya/cas) and the spec if the on-S3 format is touched (frozen since 26.6.4: new version + compatibility path)
- [ ] #4 No fallback paths added; failures propagate
