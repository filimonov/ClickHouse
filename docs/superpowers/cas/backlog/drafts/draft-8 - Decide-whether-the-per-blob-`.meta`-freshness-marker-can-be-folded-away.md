## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
The `.meta` sibling doubles blob object count and LIST enumeration. Idea: write it only when needed (for example only on `Condemned`).
It is protocol-adjacent: the marker carries freshness and the GC condemn state, and GC spends a PUT, a GET and a DELETE on it per garbage blob (audit F7).
Decision-4: any change ships as a new format version with a compatibility path. Decision-1 does not cover `.meta` but the same "instrument first, owner approves" rule applies.
The envelope's own open question is `formats-and-storage.md#blob-envelope-never-read-back` (u14).

Provenance: BACKLOG/performance.md#per-blob-meta-sibling-object-count (fold question; 2031-triage CAS-117). Verified 2026-09-26 against 59494ebf366.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Owner go/no-go recorded, based on the FSCK body/`.meta` split from a real pool
- [ ] #2 If go: a spec names the format version and how old pools with `.meta` everywhere stay readable
<!-- AC:END -->

## Definition of Done
<!-- DOD:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 CAS* gtest gate green (utils/cas-gate); LOGICAL_ERROR expectations are death tests
- [ ] #2 ASan lane green for touched suites
- [ ] #3 Docs updated where user-visible (docs/en/antalya/cas) and the spec if the on-S3 format is touched (frozen since 26.6.4: new version + compatibility path)
- [ ] #4 No fallback paths added; failures propagate
