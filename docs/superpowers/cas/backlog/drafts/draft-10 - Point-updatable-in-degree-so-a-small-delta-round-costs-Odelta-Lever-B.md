## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Measured cost of a non-idle small-delta round: 87 ms at 400 parts, 93 s at 10k tables, 398 s at 100k parts.
A point-updatable in-degree structure would make it O(delta). Spec B1 already removes the per-round ref-prefix LIST this
item also claimed; what remains is the O(universe) reduce and run rewrite, overlapping `gc-snapshot-log-structured-runs`.
Needs a new format version (decision-4). Decide whether to pursue it or fold it into the log-structured runs design.

Provenance: BACKLOG/gc.md [Lever B].

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 The owner decides pursue, merge into gc-snapshot-log-structured-runs, or close
<!-- AC:END -->

## Definition of Done
<!-- DOD:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 CAS* gtest gate green (utils/cas-gate); LOGICAL_ERROR expectations are death tests
- [ ] #2 ASan lane green for touched suites
- [ ] #3 Docs updated where user-visible (docs/en/antalya/cas) and the spec if the on-S3 format is touched (frozen since 26.6.4: new version + compatibility path)
- [ ] #4 No fallback paths added; failures propagate
