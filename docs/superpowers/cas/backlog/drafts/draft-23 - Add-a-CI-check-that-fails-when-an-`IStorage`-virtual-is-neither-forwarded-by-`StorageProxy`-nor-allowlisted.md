## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
If the feature stays. The audit found no compile-time guard for "new `IStorage` virtual not forwarded", which is how the
class keeps recurring. Proposal: a Clang-AST check comparing virtual `IStorage` declarations with `StorageProxy` overrides,
with an allowlist that requires a rationale per omission. Not present in `utils/check-style` or CI on either branch.

Provenance: BACKLOG/operability-and-introspection.md#lazy-load-tables-decision-2026-07-21 ([storageproxy-ast-interface-guard]); verified 2026-09-26 against dd0ed2f263a and 0dbbd797792.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Adding a virtual to `IStorage` without a forward or an allowlist entry fails CI
- [ ] #2 Every current omission is allowlisted with a one-line reason
<!-- AC:END -->

## Definition of Done
<!-- DOD:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 CAS* gtest gate green (utils/cas-gate); LOGICAL_ERROR expectations are death tests
- [ ] #2 ASan lane green for touched suites
- [ ] #3 Docs updated where user-visible (docs/en/antalya/cas) and the spec if the on-S3 format is touched (frozen since 26.6.4: new version + compatibility path)
- [ ] #4 No fallback paths added; failures propagate
