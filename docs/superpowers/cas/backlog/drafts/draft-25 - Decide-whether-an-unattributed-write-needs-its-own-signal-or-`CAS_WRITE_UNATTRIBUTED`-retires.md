## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
`CAS_WRITE_UNATTRIBUTED` (error code 1037, `src/Common/ErrorCodes.cpp:690`) is unreachable on the Native/S3 path: its only
throw site is `emuMintToken` on the emulated backend (`CA/Backend/CasObjectStorageBackend.cpp:573`), and the request engine
settles a 2xx that fits no grammar by a resolve read, giving up as `GaveUp{Unresolved}`. The three tests that pinned the throw
now pin the give-up. Spec revision 13 left this as an open product question.

Provenance: BACKLOG/operability-and-introspection.md#cas-write-unattributed-product-question (2026-09-03); verified 2026-09-26 against dd0ed2f263a and 0dbbd797792.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 An owner decision is recorded: add an unattributed-write event/counter, or retire the error code and the emulated throw
- [ ] #2 The three tests that pinned the old throw match the decision
<!-- AC:END -->

## Definition of Done
<!-- DOD:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 CAS* gtest gate green (utils/cas-gate); LOGICAL_ERROR expectations are death tests
- [ ] #2 ASan lane green for touched suites
- [ ] #3 Docs updated where user-visible (docs/en/antalya/cas) and the spec if the on-S3 format is touched (frozen since 26.6.4: new version + compatibility path)
- [ ] #4 No fallback paths added; failures propagate
<!-- DOD:END -->
