## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Frozen by owner decision 2026-09-16 as "not designed". Idea: after an authoritative drain, delete a retired life's
`namespaceStreamPrefix` and `namespaceStatePrefix` directly instead of waiting for the global janitor page.
Three codex rounds found five unfenced readers or writers: `retired_lives` is observation, not proof; two GC actors can
overlap; `Removing` lives still have recovery readers that throw `CORRUPTED_DATA` over drained inputs; an in-flight
`_snap` PUT can land after the drain; bulk deletion is not all-or-nothing.
Unfreeze condition: a retirement-fence invariant designed on its own (who may read or write a retired prefix until which
durable event; recovery, publisher admission and DROP retry consult it), and only if B4 leaves the janitor unable to keep up.
Open owner question with no default: may a round's drain phase perform physical deletes at all.

Provenance: BACKLOG/gc.md#targeted-drain-of-retired-lives; also the open question in #janitor-page-hardcoded corrections.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 The owner answers whether the drain phase may perform physical deletes
- [ ] #2 B4 measurements show whether the janitor keeps up; if it does, this draft is closed
<!-- AC:END -->

## Definition of Done
<!-- DOD:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 CAS* gtest gate green (utils/cas-gate); LOGICAL_ERROR expectations are death tests
- [ ] #2 ASan lane green for touched suites
- [ ] #3 Docs updated where user-visible (docs/en/antalya/cas) and the spec if the on-S3 format is touched (frozen since 26.6.4: new version + compatibility path)
- [ ] #4 No fallback paths added; failures propagate
