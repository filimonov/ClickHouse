## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Option C of the dead-namespace debris study: a terminal snapshot at namespace removal. Needs a second fold-intake rule
for a `Removing` life, a re-proof of fold-seal determinism under crash replay, and writer-side destructive rights.
Not scheduled. Own spec and TLA+ safety gate before any code.

Provenance: BACKLOG/gc.md#gc-terminal-snapshot-fold-intake; verified 2026-09-26 against aefe80eba98 (cas-gc-rebuild) and altinity/antalya-26.6 (not started).

<!-- AC:END -->

## Definition of Done
<!-- DOD:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 CAS* gtest gate green (utils/cas-gate); LOGICAL_ERROR expectations are death tests
- [ ] #2 ASan lane green for touched suites
- [ ] #3 Docs updated where user-visible (docs/en/antalya/cas) and the spec if the on-S3 format is touched (frozen since 26.6.4: new version + compatibility path)
- [ ] #4 No fallback paths added; failures propagate
