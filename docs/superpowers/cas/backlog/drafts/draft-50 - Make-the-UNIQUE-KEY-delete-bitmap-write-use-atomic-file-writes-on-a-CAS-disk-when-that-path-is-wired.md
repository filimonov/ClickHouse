## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
The generic crash-safe pattern (write `<name>.tmp`, then `replaceFile`) cannot work on a committed CA part across two autocommit
transactions: `moveFile` services only sources staged in the same transaction and throws `LOGICAL_ERROR` otherwise
(`CA/ContentAddressedTransaction.cpp:1580-1586`). The one caller, `DeleteBitmapFileOps::writeBitmapToStorage`
(`src/Storages/MergeTree/UniqueKey/DeleteBitmapFileOps.cpp:48`), is reached only from `MergeTreeBitmapStore::installBitmap`,
which has no caller outside its store and gtests, behind `allow_experimental_unique_key`.
The escape hatch exists: `IDataPartStorage::supportsAtomicFileWrites` (true for CA), used by
`VersionMetadataOnDisk::storeInfoToDataPartStorage` since `45e43b37aaf`.

Provenance: BACKLOG/replication.md#tmp-replacefile-on-committed-part (2031-triage CAS-057); draft because the path is unwired. Verified 2026-09-26 against 8b87aa15d21 (cas-gc-rebuild).

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 When the delete-bitmap path gets a production caller, `writeBitmapToStorage` takes the atomic-write branch and a CA-disk test covers it
<!-- AC:END -->

## Definition of Done
<!-- DOD:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 CAS* gtest gate green (utils/cas-gate); LOGICAL_ERROR expectations are death tests
- [ ] #2 ASan lane green for touched suites
- [ ] #3 Docs updated where user-visible (docs/en/antalya/cas) and the spec if the on-S3 format is touched (frozen since 26.6.4: new version + compatibility path)
- [ ] #4 No fallback paths added; failures propagate
