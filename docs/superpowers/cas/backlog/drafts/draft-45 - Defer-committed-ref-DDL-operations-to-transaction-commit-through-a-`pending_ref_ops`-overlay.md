## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
The one-pipeline transaction overlay covers the part-build path only. Committed-ref DDL ops (`removeDirectory`,
`removeRecursive`, `republishRef`, `dropNamespace` for DROP/MOVE/RENAME TABLE) and verbatim files are durable at call time.
Interim risk: a DDL that applies a durable ref-op and then aborts before disk commit keeps the early drop. No motivating bug;
highest regression risk (empty-cover `commitTransaction` workaround, DROP/DETACH/ATTACH rollback). `pending_ref_ops` exists on
neither branch; the spec and plan (`2026-07-15-cas-txn-one-pipeline-design.md`, `2026-07-16-cas-txn-one-pipeline.md`) survive
only in git history.
First step before any code: audit whether any single CA transaction interleaves an overlay-deferred part op with an immediate
DDL or verbatim op in an order-sensitive way. A dangling or lost part in the DDL gates means pull this forward.

Provenance: BACKLOG/formats-and-storage.md [TXN-ONE-PIPELINE follow-up] (also orphaned-open cluster C-1118). Verified 2026-09-26 against 8b87aa15d21 (cas-gc-rebuild) and 8d62c314ec1 (altinity/antalya-26.6).

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 The interleaving audit is recorded, and it decides whether the overlay is needed
<!-- AC:END -->

## Definition of Done
<!-- DOD:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 CAS* gtest gate green (utils/cas-gate); LOGICAL_ERROR expectations are death tests
- [ ] #2 ASan lane green for touched suites
- [ ] #3 Docs updated where user-visible (docs/en/antalya/cas) and the spec if the on-S3 format is touched (frozen since 26.6.4: new version + compatibility path)
- [ ] #4 No fallback paths added; failures propagate
