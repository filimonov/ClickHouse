## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Retire/recheck O(universe) HEAD phases are gone; the residual is one condemn HEAD per newly condemned blob, which the
read-ahead already overlaps (spec A2). A stored token in the manifest would remove it but is a manifest schema change
(new format version, decision-4) and removes a protocol step (AGENTS.md invariants 5 and 9). No `StoredToken` symbol exists
on either branch. Related: `[PROMOTE-REVALIDATION-MINIMIZATION]`.

Decision-1 (HEAD-before-PUT on blobs stays; protocol-step optimisations vetoed) is read as the blob PUBLISH path; the GC-side HEAD before a conditional DELETE is a separate protocol step that the roadmap lists under "decide" (cheaper GC per garbage blob). This draft therefore needs an explicit owner decision before any work; it must not be scheduled on the strength of decision-1 being publish-only.

Provenance: BACKLOG/gc.md [B148]. Verified 2026-09-26: no stored-token symbol on 59494ebf366 or 0dbbd797792.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 The owner decides whether the condemn HEAD is worth a format version after A2 lands; otherwise close
<!-- AC:END -->

## Definition of Done
<!-- DOD:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 CAS* gtest gate green (utils/cas-gate); LOGICAL_ERROR expectations are death tests
- [ ] #2 ASan lane green for touched suites
- [ ] #3 Docs updated where user-visible (docs/en/antalya/cas) and the spec if the on-S3 format is touched (frozen since 26.6.4: new version + compatibility path)
- [ ] #4 No fallback paths added; failures propagate
<!-- DOD:END -->
