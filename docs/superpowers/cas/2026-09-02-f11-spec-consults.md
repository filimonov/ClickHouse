# F11 relink-confirm liveness: spec consults (2026-09-02) {#f11-spec-consults}

The spec and plan cited below (`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-02-cas-relink-confirm-liveness-design.md`,
`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-02-cas-relink-confirm-liveness.md`) were deleted in `05b2a33ff32`;
landed, see `5740d2a2953`, `10d571917c7`.

Verbatim reports produced while the design in
relink confirm liveness (`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-02-cas-relink-confirm-liveness-design.md`) moved from revision 1
to revision 8. Kept because the spec cites them and because two of them contain the evidence walks
(attempt lifetime, committed-ref mutation inventory) that the spec summarises. Model names and effort:
codex `gpt-5.6-sol` at high reasoning, read-only sandbox; the Claude consult is an independent `ca-arch`
agent with no access to the codex transcripts. Line numbers refer to the tree at the time of each round.


## Codex round 1, revision 1: REQUEST CHANGES {#codex-round-1}

1. **CODE — blocker:** The proposed broken-lane-only rule permits the existing stale-cache counterexample for a live committed-ref repoint.

   `publishStaging` explicitly supports standalone writes and removals on an already committed ref and calls `repointRef` without consulting the `MergeTree` part state (`ContentAddressedTransaction.cpp:352-405`). `PartWriteTxn::promote` then retires the old committed binding and promotes the replacement in the same ref-log record (`CasPartWriteTxn.cpp:863-913`). The part can remain `Active` or `Outdated`; for example, `CHECK TABLE` selects those states and may call `writeChecksums`, which commits a storage transaction (`StorageMergeTree.cpp:3344-3377`, `IMergeTreeDataPart.cpp:1725-1745`).

   The unsafe execution is:

   1. The sender offers manifest `m1` while the part is `Active`.
   2. A live repoint from `m1` to `m2` becomes durable before receiver T1, retiring an edge of `m1`, but the sender’s row still reads `m1` while the lane is `Writing` or publishing its frontier.
   3. GC folds that removal and advances deletion far enough that a later receiver edge cannot prevent the already-decided deletion.
   4. Receiver T1 publishes its edge.
   5. Gate 0 still sees `Active`; the proposed rule admits `Writing`; rule 5 reads stale `m1` and answers `Yes`; T3 promotes a dangling manifest.

   This is already the existing `_sab_stalecache` trace: the model permits `SenderAdmit(Other)`, makes the repoint durable while retaining the stale row (`CaRelinkConfirmCore.tla:166-188,367-370`), and records the resulting deletion and false `Yes` (`CaRelinkConfirmCore_RESULTS.md:126-143`). The claim that T1 “keeps them alive regardless” at spec lines 69-71 applies only when the removal is admitted after T1; it does not repair a removal durable before T1.

   The different gate-0 and ledger locks do not produce a separate counterexample for ordinary whole-part removal. Gate 0 releases the parts lock before entering the ledger (`DataPartsExchange.cpp:246-268`), but if it reads `Active` before the transition to `Deleting`, the later removal append is after T1 and therefore protected. If the removal predates T1, rollback can expose `Outdated` only after the append has returned applied, conclusively failed, or fenced its lane. The live-repoint path breaks that reasoning because it performs no part-state transition.

   The complete committed-ref mutation inventory is:

   | Path | Part state when the removal/repoint append is issued | Result |
   |---|---|---|
   | Standalone committed-file write/removal through `publishStaging` → `repointRef` | May remain `Active` or `Outdated` | **Unsafe under the proposed rule** if the replacement retires a blob edge |
   | Normal old-part cleanup through `IMergeTreeDataPart::remove` | `Deleting`; `DeleteOnDestroy` for the old side of MOVE | Gate 0 refuses |
   | Destructor cleanup of a temporary part | `Temporary`, generally not registered in `data_parts` | Gate 0 cannot find it |
   | `delete_tmp_*` rename and subsequent deletion | `Deleting` or `DeleteOnDestroy` | Destination ref is published before source drop |
   | Force-detach | Changed to `Deleting` before `renameToDetached` (`MergeTreeData.cpp:6031-6060`) | Safe |
   | Ordinary detach/attach | Detached destination is cloned/published before the live source is outdated; attach operates before the new part is registered (`MergeTreeData.cpp:5903-5916,8895-8926`) | Safe |
   | Merge/mutation temporary result rename | `Temporary`/`PreActive`, or only staged; committed-source variants publish destination first | Safe |
   | MOVE PART TO DISK/VOLUME | Old part becomes `DeleteOnDestroy`, replacement becomes `Active` under the parts lock (`MergeTreeData.cpp:6429-6457`) | Safe; gate 0 also checks the routed disk |
   | RENAME TABLE | Source parts remain `Active`/`Outdated` (`MergeTreeData.cpp:4105-4135`) | Safe only because each destination ref is published before its source is dropped (`ContentAddressedTransaction.cpp:1260-1298`) |
   | DROP/TRUNCATE | Parts become `Outdated` and then `Deleting`, or directly `Deleting` for table teardown (`MergeTreeData.cpp:3541-3609,4151-4204`) | Safe |
   | Projection removal | Non-temporary projections cannot be removed independently; they are nested in and removed with the parent manifest (`IMergeTreeDataPart.cpp:2448-2461`) | Parent state governs |
   | FREEZE/backup shadow cleanup | Drops shadow refs, not the live part ref (`ContentAddressedTransaction.cpp:1069-1107`) | No live part object involved |
   | Restore/ATTACH | Uses detached or staged refs before activation | Safe |
   | Partial multi-ref commit rollback via `dropRefIfMatches` | Newly created, not-yet-activated ref; existing repoints are deliberately not dropped (`ContentAddressedTransaction.cpp:482-535`) | Safe |
   | Detached/moving container cleanup | No `Active`/`Outdated` part object | Safe |
   | Namespace decommission | Administrative mount refuses a live or contended server lease (`CasPool.cpp:668-697`) | No live answering sender |
   | Zero-copy removal | Uses the same `Outdated` → `Deleting` removal path (`MergeTreeData.cpp:3498-3517`) | No additional CAS-ref path |

2. **CODE — blocker:** The proposed TLA plan would prove safety by constraining away real transitions.

   Spec lines 123-132 allow removal journal admission only while the modelled part is `Deleting`. That excludes both the blocker above and several legitimate code paths:

   - Direct `Active → Deleting`, used by `dropAllData` and force-detach (`MergeTreeData.cpp:4183,6057`).
   - `Active → DeleteOnDestroy` and replacement `DeleteOnDestroy → Active` during MOVE (`MergeTreeData.cpp:6451-6457`).
   - Direct temporary-part destruction (`IMergeTreeDataPart.cpp:993-1028`).
   - Live `OwnerTransition` repoints which retire an old committed binding without changing part state (`CasPartWriteTxn.cpp:890-913`).
   - `republishRef` as two distinct durable steps, destination publication followed by source removal (`PartFolderAccess.cpp:506-533`).
   - RENAME TABLE source removals while parts are still `Active`/`Outdated` (`MergeTreeData.cpp:4105-4135`).

   A green result under the proposed `Deleting`-only constraint would therefore not re-derive `ConfirmedRelinkNeverDangles` for the implementation. The model must represent protector ordering, not just a four-state part lifecycle.

3. **PROSE — medium:** The stated removal invariant and cited call sites are factually inaccurate.

   - “The only entry to physical removal is `asMutableDeletingPart`” at spec lines 58-61 is false. `removeIfNeeded` directly invokes `remove` for temporary and `DeleteOnDestroy` parts (`IMergeTreeDataPart.cpp:969-1030`).
   - Ordinary fast part removal drops the ref through `removeDirectory` at `ContentAddressedTransaction.cpp:1031-1037`; the cited line 1075 is the FREEZE shadow-part branch of `removeRecursive`.
   - “For every path … the part has left `{Active, Outdated}`” at lines 77-79 is false for live repoints and RENAME TABLE.
   - The claim that every `republishRef` source is staged, `Deleting`, or detached is false for RENAME TABLE, although that path remains protected by publish-before-drop.
   - Temporary parts are not universally moved to `Deleting`; destructor cleanup may remove them directly.

   These distinctions matter because only some paths are made safe by gate 0; other paths depend on an existing destination protector or on there being no registered part.

4. **PROSE — medium:** The `rollbackDeletingParts` taxonomy does not match the lane state machine.

   An ambiguous append that was sent initially transitions `Writing → Wedged`, not directly to `NeedsRecovery` (`CasRefLedger.cpp:3935-4006`). `NeedsRecovery` is used when a transaction is known durable but its frontier or in-memory installation cannot be completed (`CasRefLedger.cpp:2169-2182,3750-3788`). Wedge resolution can later apply the transaction and return `Ready`, remain `Wedged`, become `NeedsRecovery`, or terminate `Closed`/`Faulted` (`CasRefLedger.cpp:2357-2389,2432-2496,2534-2543`).

   The omitted fourth case is a sent operation conclusively proven not durable: `DefiniteFailure` clears the attempt and restores `Ready` (`CasRefLedger.cpp:3916-3933`). There is also a distinct pre-send `Unresolved` result which proves no request was sent and restores `Ready` (`CasRefLedger.cpp:3962-3991`).

   I did not find an additional unsafe rollback outcome once those states are represented: an applied removal makes rule 5 return `No`; an ambiguous one remains fenced; and a definite/pre-send failure leaves the old row valid. The prepared-relink abandon path also retains its terminal obligation and retries after a thrown removal append (`ContentAddressedMetadataStorage.cpp:2260-2277`, `CasPartWriteTxn.cpp:1079-1083`).

5. **PROSE — medium:** The verification plan misses the exact unsafe race.

   The proposed unit test only confirms that an unrelated ref can return `Yes` while the lane is busy (`spec:151-155`). It must also exercise the same ref while an old committed binding has become durable but the stale row is still visible. A deterministic test should:

   - Offer old manifest `m1`.
   - Durably repoint the same live ref to a manifest that omits one old blob.
   - Pause after the log PUT or during frontier publication, before row installation.
   - Advance GC past the old edge.
   - Publish receiver T1 late.
   - Verify that confirm cannot authorize `m1`.

   Tests should also cover `republishRef` destination-before-source, RENAME TABLE with `Active` parts, MOVE’s `DeleteOnDestroy` transition, and the distinct rollback outcomes above. The delayed-`_ckpt` integration test is useful for liveness but does not deliberately create a same-ref edge-retiring repoint.

   The rollout compatibility claim itself is supported: this changes only sender answer selection and neither the wire token nor persisted formats (`ContentAddressedExchange.h:142-145`). It is unsafe to roll out only because the new `Yes` set is currently too broad.

6. **PROSE — low:** The documentation and observability updates are incomplete.

   The implementation plan mentions changing comments only at gate 0 and `asMutableDeletingPart`, but the new semantics would also contradict the `RefLaneState` and `ConfirmAnswer` documentation saying only `Ready` certifies a row (`CasRefLedger.h:40-60,147-159`) and the exchange interface saying a busy table returns `Unknown` (`ContentAddressedExchange.h:170-176`).

   The proposed “per refusing rule” counters also omit `state_mutex` contention, which independently returns `Unknown` at `CasRefLedger.cpp:453-462`. It needs its own reason or an explicit mapping to one of the named counters.

REQUEST CHANGES

Exact changes required:

- Retain refusal for a potentially ref-affecting `Writing` attempt, or design a narrower predicate that proves the active attempt cannot retire the queried manifest’s blob edges. A table-wide broken-state predicate is insufficient.
- Either prohibit/enforce blob-set-monotone repoints on `Active`/`Outdated` parts, or treat an edge-shrinking live repoint as a removal requiring an earlier state transition or another already-durable protector.
- Revise the TLA model to include live `OwnerTransition` repoints, `DeleteOnDestroy`, temporary/unregistered parts, direct `Active → Deleting`, and the two-step `republishRef` protocol. The existing stale-cache sabotage must remain a counterexample until the implementation has a real guard.
- Add the deterministic same-ref, durable-before-T1 stale-row regression described above, plus coverage for rename/MOVE/rollback state variants.
- Correct the removal-path prose, citations, rollback state taxonomy, header/interface documentation, and refusal-counter classification.


## Claude consult, revision 2: APPROVE WITH NITS; revision 3 check: APPROVE {#claude-consult}

### Consult: CAS relink-confirm liveness design, revision 2 (F11) {#consult-cas-relink-confirm-liveness-design-revision-2-f11}

Consultant: Claude (Fable 5.1), independent of the other model's consult. Read-only.
Spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-02-cas-relink-confirm-liveness-design.md` (revision 2).
Code read at branch `cas-gc-rebuild`, HEAD `9041853b181`. Every line number below is from that tree.

#### Verdict {#verdict}

**APPROVE WITH NITS.** I tried to refute the design on all six attack lines and could not. The
load-bearing claim, that every durable mutation which can make the sender's committed row lag is an
armed `append_attempt` whose ops name the affected refs, is true of the code in front of me. The nits
are prose defects in the spec that would misdirect the implementer or leave a false invariant in a
code comment; none changes the design. Four of them (F1, F2, F4, F6) must land in revision 3 before
the implementation task is cut.

#### Failure asymmetry, stated first {#asymmetry}

Over-refusal (`Unknown`) costs the receiver one retry. Under-refusal (`Yes` on a stale row) lets a
receiver promote a manifest whose blob GC may already have deleted. Every ambiguity in the design must
therefore resolve toward refusing, and revision 2 does: unknown op kinds are namespace-wide,
`Wedged` keeps refusing for its refs, `NeedsRecovery`/`Closed`/`Faulted` refuse everything.

#### Attack results {#attacks}

##### A. Is `append_attempt` armed for the whole window in which the store can hold a transaction the row does not reflect? {#attack-a}

Yes. Verified transitions, all under `state_mutex`:

- **Arm before first send.** `commitRefChunk` arms the attempt and sets `Writing` at
  `CasRefLedger.cpp:3585-3596`; the only ref-log `PUT` of the commit path is at `:3625`, after it. A
  failed arm (`!attempt_armed`) sends nothing (`:3598-3614`).
- **During the PUT.** Attempt armed, `Writing`.
- **Committed → frontier publication → install.** The frontier `_ckpt` publish (`:3766-3795`) runs
  with the attempt still armed. A publish throw or `FencedOut` calls `requireRecovery`
  (`:3783`, `:3794`), which sets `NeedsRecovery` and does NOT clear the attempt (`:2169-2176`). The
  install swaps the state, swaps the attempt out and sets `Ready` in one critical section
  (`:3855-3859`), preceded by a `state_unchanged` check that the armed attempt is still this one
  (`:3822-3829`). A stale runtime refuses to install and goes `NeedsRecovery` (`:3818-3821`, `:3840`).
- **Unresolved after a real send.** `Wedged`, attempt retained (`:3993-3998`); same on a
  non-`CORRUPTED_DATA` exception after the send boundary (`:3636-3643`).
- **Unresolved with nothing sent** (`NoAttemptSent`, `attempts_sent == 0`). Attempt cleared, `Ready`
  (`:3964-3971`). Nothing reached the network, so the store cannot hold it.
- **DefiniteFailure.** Attempt cleared, `Ready` (`:3919-3926`). The controller's contract
  (`Backend/CasRequestControl.h:469-476`) returns it only when every attempt of the call was proven
  never applied; an ambiguous predecessor forces `Unresolved`. Pre-existing, unchanged by the design.
- **Different object at our key.** `Faulted` (`:3686-3690`, `:3734-3738`) or `Closed` (`:3708-3712`),
  both refuse everything.
- **Wedge resolution.** Reads the same attempt (`:2216-2229`), re-sends the same bytes (`:2286`),
  publishes the frontier with the attempt still armed, installs and unwedges in one hold
  (`:2530-2538`). Every non-adoption arm leaves the attempt in place or moves to a refuse-all state.
- **Recovery.** `ensureRefTableRecovered` copies `retained_attempt` (`:1434`) and releases
  `state_mutex` around I/O (`:1486`, `:1582`) with `recovery_in_progress = true`, which rule 2 refuses
  (`:456-460`). `installRecoveryResult` clears the attempt and sets `Ready` only after installing the
  replayed state (`:1638-1640`).
- **Chunked flush.** Between chunk N's install and chunk N+1's arm the lane is `Ready` with no attempt
  (`:3006-3044`); the row reflects N, N+1 has not been sent. `flushRefBatch` itself never writes
  `rt->state` or the attempt (grep: the only `rt->state` writers are `:1625`, `:2534`, `:3855`).
- **The `Faulted` arm at new-id allocation** (`:3365-3400`) clears the attempt but goes `Faulted`.

No path clears or swaps the attempt while the row is behind the store.

##### B. Can a committed ref be mutated by anything that does not pass through the lane? {#attack-b}

No binding change can. Every ref-binding writer funnels into `appendRefOps`:
`PartFolderAccess.cpp:660` (`dropRefIfMatches`; `republishRef`/`repointRef`/`dropRefIfPresent` reach
the same ledger `dropRef`/publish path), `CasPartWriteTxn.cpp:657,769,1044` (publish, promote,
precommit), `CasPool.cpp:1524` (writer-cleanup precommit abandon), `CasPool.cpp:1883`. `RENAME`,
detach/attach, `MOVE`, `DROP`/`TRUNCATE`, FREEZE cleanup all reduce to these (the spec's inventory
matches what I read; `republishRef` is indeed publish-then-drop, two transactions,
`PartFolderAccess.cpp:506-536`).

Direct ref-log writers outside the lane, exhaustively (grep for `refLogKey(`, `putIfAbsentControlled(`,
`slotOccupy(` outside tests): the recovery walk's epoch seal (`makeEpochSealTxn` `:137-150`, sent via
`slotOccupy` at `:1132`). It carries no table content, so it changes no binding, and it runs while
`recovery_in_progress` is true, which rule 2 refuses. The other two `putIfAbsentControlled` callers in
the ledger are staging (`:251`) and snapshot publish (`:4427`), neither a ref-log transaction. GC
(`CasGc.cpp:3375`) deletes checkpointed ref-log objects and never changes a binding; fsck and the
orphan sweep only read (`CasFsck.cpp:378`, `CasOrphanManifestSweep.cpp:255,304`). A foreign writer after
fence loss is rule 6's business, unchanged.

##### C. Is the touched-ref set derivable and complete for every `RefOpKind`? {#attack-c}

Yes. `RefOpKind` has five kinds (`Formats/CasRefLogFormat.h:35-42`). The apply rules
(`Pool/CasRefProtocol.h:368-393`) show that the only ops that change a committed binding are
`OwnerTransition` remove (exact `old_binding` must exist) and promote (same `ref_name` on both sides,
never displaces another row implicitly); add creates a precommit only. `SetPublishedAt` names
`ref_name` and cannot change the manifest edge (`:279-280`, `:389-390`). `RemoveNamespace` requires both
maps already empty (`:391-393`), so it unbinds nothing itself. `EpochSeal` and `NamespaceBirth` carry no
`RefOp` fields. No op unbinds a ref without naming it. Marking the three field-less kinds namespace-wide
is conservative and correct.

##### D. Locking {#attack-d}

The confirm holds `ref_queue_mutex` and `try_to_lock`s `state_mutex` (`:438`, `:447-449`). Under the
new rule everything rule 3 reads (`lane_state`, `append_attempt`, `state`) lives under `state_mutex`,
and every writer of those three takes `state_mutex` (`:3585`, `:3855`, `:2530`, `:1638`, `:2169` callers).
Arming precedes the send, so there is no instant at which a touching transaction has been sent and the
confirm can observe `Ready` or a non-touching attempt. The leader reads the attempt's `key`/`bytes`
outside the lock through `active_attempt` (`:3616`) but never mutates it after arming; new fields
inherit that. `ref_queue_mutex` is no longer needed for the rule-3 conjunction, only for the slot lookup
(`:443-446`); see S5.

##### E. What did `pending`/`leader_active` protect that the sent-transaction check does not? {#attack-e}

Nothing that the safety argument needs:

- **Queued, unsent removal of the queried ref.** It becomes durable only after the confirm (T2), and
  the receiver's `+1` was durable at T1 < T2 (the receiver's `appendRefOps` returns after install and
  frontier publication). The blob is protected continuously. This is the protocol's existing argument
  and does not depend on the sender's queue being empty.
- **Leader between two chunks.** Row equals store (A above).
- **Leader inside `build_ops` or catalog reads** (`:3013`, `:2966`; `:3289-3350`). Nothing sent.
- **Partially durable tenure** (the old comment's justification, `:474-478`). Committed chunks are
  installed; the in-flight chunk is armed; the rest is unsent. Row plus attempt describe it exactly.
- **A live repoint** (`ContentAddressedTransaction.cpp:392` → `repointRef`). Its `OwnerTransition` names
  the ref on both sides, so the confirm refuses for that ref while it is armed and answers `No` after
  install (mint-tightening makes the new `ManifestRef` differ).
- **`Wedged` with a non-touching attempt.** A wedge is an ambiguous PUT, not evidence of deposition;
  deposition is `Closed` or a lost fence, both still refused.

##### F. Can the model and tests miss the failure they are meant to catch? {#attack-f}

The model can, as currently planned, in one way (F6). The tests can, in one way (F4). Details below.

#### Findings {#findings}

1. **PROSE, medium — the "recovery re-arm at `CasRefLedger.cpp:1876`" does not exist.** Line 1876 is
   inside `forceWedgeForTest` (`:1866-1878`), a test seam. Production has exactly one arming site,
   `:3592`. Recovery never re-arms an attempt: it copies `retained_attempt` (`:1434`) for
   adjudication and `installRecoveryResult` clears it (`:1638`). Spec §rule-3 ("filled where an
   attempt is built: in `prepareRefChunk` ... and on the recovery path that re-arms a wedged attempt")
   and §consult ("does `Wedged` ever hold an attempt whose ref set is stale") must be rewritten: one
   production fill site in `prepareRefChunk` (`:3213-3216`, from `chunk_txn.ops`); `forceWedgeForTest`
   sets `touches_namespace = true` because its bytes are test-supplied and need not decode.

2. **PROSE, medium — the docs-to-change list misses the comment that becomes false.** The
   function-header paragraph at `CasRefLedger.cpp:426-435` says the two-mutex snapshot exists because
   "`pending`/`leader_active` live under `ref_queue_mutex`" and concludes "There is no interleaving in
   which a removal is admitted and this function still answers `Yes`." Under the design a removal CAN
   be admitted (queued) while the confirm answers `Yes`, by design and safely. Also `CasRefLedger.h:40`
   ("`Ready` is the only state that ... certifies a cached row"), `:60` ("busy or non-`Ready` table
   answers `Unknown`") and `:156-159` ("lane state `Ready`" and "the two-mutex hold"). Add all four to
   §docs; the spec currently names only "the rule 3 comment block" (`:471-480`).

3. **PROSE, low — "Rule 4 (apply-pending poison)" is not a separate check in the code.** The poison of
   the model (`sPoison`) is `NeedsRecovery`, entered via `requireRecovery` (`:2169-2176`); the confirm
   covers it through `lane_state` alone. Say so, or the implementer will look for a rule 4 to preserve.

4. **PROSE/TEST, medium — a table-driven completeness test cannot see a kind it does not list.** §tests
   proposes "a unit test that `touched_refs` is complete for every `RefOpKind`, driven from a table of
   one op per kind, so a future kind without a mapping fails the test." A hand-maintained table fails
   open for the exact case it is meant to catch. The codebase's existing tool is a `switch` over
   `RefOpKind` with no `default` (`CasRefLogFormat.cpp:80`, `:193`; `CasRefProtocol.cpp:405`), which turns
   a new enumerator into a compile error under the project's warnings-as-errors. Require the derivation
   to be written that way; keep a per-kind semantic test if wanted, but it is no longer the guard.

5. **PROSE, low — "an epoch-seal attempt in flight" is not a production scenario.** `EpochSeal` is
   minted only by the recovery walk (`:1107`) and written with `slotOccupy` (`:1132`), never through
   `commitRefChunk`. The namespace-wide test is constructible only via `forceWedgeForTest` with seal
   bytes and then tests the flag, which is fine; reframe it as "a forced wedge whose bytes cannot be
   attributed to refs refuses every ref".

6. **PROSE, medium — the model plan under-specifies the extension and can pass vacuously.** Today's
   model has no armed state: `SenderAdmit` (`CaRelinkConfirmCore.tla:166`) sets `sPending` and
   `sLeader` together, `SenderDurable` (`:180`) is atomic, and rule 3 is `~sPending /\ ~sLeader`
   (`:269`). Revision 3 must state: (a) a new `sArmed` set by an arm step that `SenderDurable` requires
   and `SenderApply` (`:192`) clears, mirroring "arm before first send" at `CasRefLedger.cpp:3585-3625`,
   stated as a code invariant the model assumes; (b) a `sTouches` choice at admit, so a non-touching
   transaction leaves `sDurableRef` unchanged (no second ref needed); (c) rule 3 becomes
   `~(sArmed /\ sTouches)`; (d) `SabotageStaleCache` drops that conjunct, and a second sabotage forces
   `sTouches = FALSE`; (e) a new non-vacuity witness "a confirm answered `yes` while `sLeader /\ sPending`",
   without which the relaxation is not shown to fire and `_main` could pass with the old behaviour.

7. **CODE observation, info — one direct ref-log writer outside the lane, harmless.** The recovery
   seal (`:1132`) bypasses `append_attempt` but changes no binding and runs under
   `recovery_in_progress`. Name it in the inventory so "every mutation goes through the lane" reads
   exactly as verified rather than as an over-claim.

8. **PROSE, low — inventory qualifier "never a live part's ref" for `dropRefIfMatches`.**
   `PartFolderAccess.cpp:646-670` removes a `RefOwnerKind::Committed` binding; the qualifier is about
   callers, not enforced, and not load-bearing under the design because the op names the ref. Drop it.

9. **Limit, info — residual `Unknown` sources the design does not remove.** The `try_to_lock` fails
   while `listRefs`/`hasAnyRefWithPrefix` iterate the whole table under `state_mutex`
   (`CasRefLedger.cpp:380`, `:400`), while the snapshot publisher copies the state, and during an
   install. Bounded, not a livelock. A confirm about a ref whose own `SetPublishedAt` or repoint is in
   flight is `Unknown` for one flush, seconds on GCS. The proposed `StateLockBusy` and
   `SentTxnTouchesRef` counters are the right instruments; if either dominates on the live gate, that is
   a different fix.

#### Exact changes required for revision 3 {#changes}

- §rule-3, §consult: replace the recovery re-arm sentence with the single fill site; state that
  `forceWedgeForTest` marks the attempt namespace-wide (F1).
- §docs: add `CasRefLedger.cpp:426-435` and `CasRefLedger.h:40`, `:60`, `:156-159` (F2).
- §rule-3 or §safety: one sentence that the model's rule 4 is `NeedsRecovery` in code (F3).
- §tests: the touched-set derivation is a `switch` with no `default`; the table test is optional (F4).
- §tests: reframe the epoch-seal case (F5).
- §model: the five items in F6.
- §inventory: add the recovery-seal row; drop the "never a live part's ref" qualifier (F7, F8).

#### Simplifications {#simplifications}

- **S1.** One fill site, not two (F1). Removes the "decode the transaction to derive the set" branch.
- **S2.** Compile-time completeness via `switch` replaces a test (F4).
- **S3.** Keep `touches_namespace` as a plain bool; do not fold it into the set. It is the fail-closed
  default for kinds without names and costs one byte.
- **S4.** `SetPublishedAt` could be excluded from the touched set safely (it cannot change the manifest
  edge, `CasRefProtocol.h:279-280`). Not recommended: including it is the simpler rule with no
  special case, and the over-refusal is one flush per publish.
- **S5.** `ref_queue_mutex` is no longer part of the rule-3 conjunction. Keep holding it (it protects
  the slot lookup and the hold is O(1)), but the comment must stop claiming the two-mutex snapshot is
  what makes `Yes` sound. No code motion.
- **S6.** Model: two booleans and one witness, no second ref, no part state.
- **S7.** The seven `ProfileEvents` are observability for the live gate, not part of the fix. They are
  justified by the gate's oracle; if the change must be smaller, ship `SentTxnTouchesRef`,
  `LaneBroken` and `StateLockBusy` and leave the rest.

#### What this consult did not establish {#limits}

- The GC LIST-completeness assumption (`MaxHoles = 0`) and the mount-fence timing of rule 6 are
  unchanged and were not re-examined.
- I did not run TLC or any test. The model claims above are about what the plan must say, not about a
  run.
- I did not read the other model's consult (`tmp/gcs_live_20260902/codex_review_f11_spec.log`), to
  keep this one independent.
- The claim "no path clears the attempt while the row is behind" is about the code at HEAD
  `9041853b181`; it is not a statement about future edits, which is why F4's compile-time guard and
  the `state_unchanged` check at `:3822-3829` matter more than the prose.

#### Revision 3 check {#revision-3-check}

Re-read revision 3 at commit `ed475cd2015` only. Every new citation and every new factual claim was
checked against the tree at that commit.

##### Required changes from the revision 2 consult {#rev3-required}

| Finding | Status | Where in revision 3 |
|---|---|---|
| F1 single fill site; `forceWedgeForTest` namespace-wide | CLOSED | §rule-3: "Production has exactly one fill site, `prepareRefChunk`"; recovery copies (`:1434`) and clears (`:1638-1640`); `forceWedgeForTest` (`:1866-1878`) sets `touches_namespace`. All three citations verified. |
| F2 docs list names the comments that become false | CLOSED | §docs: `CasRefLedger.cpp:426-435`, `:471-480`; `CasRefLedger.h:40`, `:60`, `:156-159`, `:577-608`. `:577-608` verified as the `RefAppendAttempt` comment and fields. |
| F3 rule 4 is `NeedsRecovery` in code | CLOSED | §safety, last paragraph. |
| F4 derivation is a `switch` with no `default` | CLOSED | §rule-3 and §tests. The new citation `CasRefProtocol.cpp:112-154` is `OwnerTransitionShape` and `classifyOwnerTransitionShape`, the four legal shapes as stated. |
| F5 epoch-seal case reframed | CLOSED | §tests: `WedgedLaneIsUnknown` stays `Unknown` because `forceWedgeForTest` marks the attempt namespace-wide. |
| F6 model plan: `sArmed`, `sTouches`, rule, two sabotages, witness | CLOSED | §model, all five items present, plus the between-chunks state. |
| F7 recovery-seal inventory row | CLOSED | §inventory, last row. |
| F8 qualifier dropped | CLOSED | §inventory, `dropRefIfMatches` row now "`OwnerTransition` removals naming their ref". |
| F9 residual `Unknown` sources | CLOSED | §tests, observability paragraph. |
| S1-S7 | REFLECTED | S5 in §rule-3 (the `ref_queue_mutex` sentence); S7 in §tests (three counters, others optional). |

##### The four named tests {#rev3-tests}

Verified in `src/Disks/tests/gtest_cas_confirm_exact_ref.cpp` at that commit:

- `InFlightAppendIsUnknown` (`:472-503`): same-ref `dropRef("x")`, leader parked by the pre-carve latch,
  confirm about `x`. The spec's phase expectations (`Yes` queued, `Unknown` armed through `Writing`, `No`
  installed) follow from the design; the "armed" phase needs the existing `PostDurableInstall` hook
  (`CasRefLedger.cpp:3797`), which the spec's regression test already uses.
- `MidTenureChunkBoundaryIsUnknown` (`:512-586`): confirm about `seed`, untouched by the two co-batched
  items, issued at `ChunkReseed`. That hook fires at `:3036`, before the reseed takes `state_mutex` at
  `:3038` and after chunk 1's install cleared the attempt, so `Yes` is the correct new expectation.
- `WedgedLaneIsUnknown` (`:589-609`): `forceWedgeForTest` with the bytes `"synthetic"`, so
  namespace-wide, `Unknown` for every ref. Correct.
- `ConcurrentAppendIsOrderedAfterTheSnapshot` (`:672-728`): same-ref removal, three phases via the
  pre-carve latch. The spec's four-phase rewrite is correct; the "admitted but unsent `Yes`" phase is
  the one the test's header comment currently calls impossible, and that comment must go with it.

No other gtest calls `confirmExactRef`. The two integration tests that wait for a refusal
(`tests/integration/test_cas_replicated_relink/test.py:792-797`, `:884-889`) induce it by merging the
source part away until no part of that name remains (`:756-766`), so the answer comes from gate 0 or
rule 5 and is unaffected by the design. Four is the complete count.

##### Newly noticed, none blocking {#rev3-new}

- **N1, PROSE, low.** §tests says the real-wedge sibling leaves a `PUT` `Unresolved` "through the
  request-control seam". Request control has only a sleep seam (`CasRequestControl.h:604`). The seams
  that produce a real wedge in existing tests are test backends: `ChunkFaultBackend::Mode::Unresolved`
  (`gtest_cas_ref_install_safety.cpp:236-262`, `UnresolvedAlwaysRecordsTheWedge`) and
  `CasInMemoryBackend::injectAmbiguousPutIfAbsent` (`CasInMemoryBackend.h:98-108`). Name one of those so
  the implementer greps for the right thing.
- **N2, PROSE, low.** §consult cites `tmp/gcs_live_20260902/` for the two consult reports. That
  directory is not tracked (`git ls-files tmp/gcs_live_20260902` is empty), so a committed spec points
  at a scratch path that will not exist for the next reader. Either commit the two reports beside the
  ledger under `docs/superpowers/cas/` or drop the path and keep the sentence.
- **N3, info.** The claim that the ambiguous-`PUT` sibling test is constructible holds: a real wedge is
  reached today from `commitRefChunk`'s `Unresolved` arm with the attempt built by `prepareRefChunk`, so
  its touched set is the derived one, which is what the sibling needs.

##### Verdict for revision 3 {#rev3-verdict}

**APPROVE.** Every required change from the revision 2 consult is closed, and every new citation in
revision 3 is correct. N1 and N2 are editorial and can be folded into the next touch of the document;
neither needs a revision 4 before the model variant or the code task is cut.


## Codex round 2, revision 2: REQUEST CHANGES (prose) {#codex-round-2}

1. **PROSE — medium:** The model plan overstates the existing model’s expressiveness. The journal records have no ref identity, the sender has only one modeled ref, and `sPending` spans admission through durability; there is no armed/sent/Wedged phase (`docs/superpowers/models/CaRelinkConfirmCore.tla:101`, `:114-120`, `:164-188`). Consequently the model cannot currently distinguish queued-unsent work from a sent attempt, or an attempt touching the queried ref from another ref, despite the claim at `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-02-cas-relink-confirm-liveness-design.md:143-150`. Add explicit attempt phase, touched-ref/namespace-wide state, and at least two sender refs; model the between-chunks no-attempt state. Define the two sabotage flags distinctly or remove the duplicate. `_sab_stalecache` will still counterexample when the touching attempt is ignored: its durable `m1 → m2` repoint leaves `sCacheRef = m1` (`CaRelinkConfirmCore_RESULTS.md:126-139`).

2. **PROSE — medium:** The test plan does not explicitly replace the existing rule-3 expectations that revision 2 reverses. A queued same-ref removal before carving currently expects `Unknown` (`src/Disks/tests/gtest_cas_confirm_exact_ref.cpp:467-503`), an untouched ref at a chunk boundary expects `Unknown` (`:507-582`), and the concurrency test expects `Unknown` from admission onward (`:663-708`). Under the proposed rule these must be `Yes` until the touching attempt is armed, then `Unknown` through `Writing`/`Wedged`, and `No` after install. Add those phase-separated assertions, plus both same-ref and unrelated-ref cases in `Writing` and `Wedged`; the current synthetic wedge test (`:586-607`) can only exercise a conservative namespace-wide fallback unless it carries or decodes a valid transaction.

3. **PROSE — medium:** “One op per `RefOpKind`” is insufficient coverage for `OwnerTransition` (`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-02-cas-relink-confirm-liveness-design.md:175-176`). The state machine has four legal shapes—new-only precommit add, old-only precommit removal, old-only committed removal, and old+new promotion (`src/Disks/DiskObjectStorage/MetadataStorages/ContentAddressed/Pool/CasRefProtocol.cpp:112-154`). Test every shape and assert extraction from both optionals; the old-only committed removal is the safety-critical case.

4. **PROSE — low:** The cited “recovery path that re-arms a wedged attempt” is actually the test-only `forceWedgeForTest` seam (`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-02-cas-relink-confirm-liveness-design.md:72-75`; `src/Disks/DiskObjectStorage/MetadataStorages/ContentAddressed/Pool/CasRefLedger.cpp:1866-1877`). Production recovery copies the retained attempt before its unlocked walk and clears it only when installing recovered state (`CasRefLedger.cpp:1432-1434`, `:1619-1640`). Correct the citation and describe how the test seam supplies conservative or decoded touch metadata. Also include the `RefAppendAttempt` field/identity comments in the documentation updates (`CasRefLedger.h:577-608`).

REQUEST CHANGES — specify the model’s ref/attempt-phase extension, update the reversed rule-3 tests with explicit queued/Writing/Wedged/chunk-boundary expectations, cover every legal `OwnerTransition` shape, and correct the line-1876 recovery claim.


## Codex round 3, revision 3: REQUEST CHANGES (prose) {#codex-round-3}

1. **PROSE — MAJOR — `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-02-cas-relink-confirm-liveness-design.md:162-179`**  
   The model extension remains under-specified. Currently `SenderAdmit` admits only `Other`/`"none"`, `SenderDurable` always emits the sender-edge deletion, and `SenderApply` clears both `sPending` and `sLeader` (`CaRelinkConfirmCore.tla:166-198,367-370`). Thus there is no honest non-touching durable transaction and no installed-between-chunks state. The proposed witness can succeed merely between admission and the new arm step, without exercising either `sArmed /\ ~sTouches` or the post-install chunk boundary. Specify an honest non-touching/noop transaction, derive `sTouches` from its actual shape except under the new sabotage, split apply from tenure completion, and add explicit witnesses for armed-non-touching `Yes` and post-install/pre-next-chunk `Yes`. With that mapping, both stale-cache sabotages will reproduce the intended counterexample.

2. **PROSE — MAJOR — `docs/superpowers/models/CaRelinkLaneComposition.tla:3-9,111-133,209`; `docs/superpowers/models/CaRefLaneCore.tla:714-722`; `docs/superpowers/models/CaRefLaneCore_RESULTS.md:68-91`**  
   The repository’s companion composition model still defines certification as `Ready`-only and treats any confirmation in `Writing`/`Wedged` as sabotage. Revision 3 changes that public seam but schedules only `CaRelinkConfirmCore.tla`. Extend the lane/composition model with attempt touch scope—or explicitly replace that obsolete contract—and rerun/update its configs and results.

3. **PROSE — MINOR — `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-02-cas-relink-confirm-liveness-design.md:236-247`**  
   The comment inventory is still incomplete. Add `CasRefLedger.h:616`, whose “COMPLETE” field enumeration will omit `touched_refs` and `touches_namespace`; `gtest_cas_confirm_exact_ref.cpp:40-46`, which explicitly forbids the newly allowed admitted-unsent `Yes`; and the affected `CaRelinkConfirmCore_RESULTS.md:85-92,126-142`. The listed `CasRefLedger.cpp:426-435,471-480` set is otherwise correct.

4. **CODE — INFO (closed) — `CasRefProtocol.cpp:112-154`; `CasRefLedger.cpp:1434,1638-1640,1866-1878,3213-3216`**  
   The four `OwnerTransition` shapes, exhaustive no-default `RefOpKind` derivation, single production fill site, retained recovery attempt, and namespace-wide `forceWedgeForTest` treatment are now described correctly. The recovery-seal inventory row is also accurate (`CasRefLedger.cpp:137-152,1107-1133`).

5. **CODE — INFO (closed) — `gtest_cas_confirm_exact_ref.cpp:467-708`; `cas_test_helpers.h:1961-2035`; `CasRefLedger.cpp:2034-2120,3748-3907`**  
   The phase expectations are correct, and `ChunkFaultBackend::Mode::Unresolved` with a single-attempt budget can construct the real wedge sibling. The queued-unsent `Yes` is sound: a sender touching transaction is armed before its first send, while receiver `appendRefOps` returns only after frontier publication, cache install, and waiter completion, so the receiver’s T1 is durable before T2.

REQUEST CHANGES — fully specify and witness the honest non-touching and between-chunks model transitions; update the `CaRefLaneCore`/`CaRelinkLaneComposition` contract and results; add the omitted comment/result files to the documentation inventory.

## Codex round 4, revision 4: REQUEST CHANGES (model plan prose) {#codex-round-4}

1. **PROSE — MAJOR — `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-02-cas-relink-confirm-liveness-design.md:171-188`**  
   Finding 1 is not fully closed. `NoOp` is a valid abstraction—the model already has edge-neutral records (`CaRelinkConfirmCore.tla:91-101`)—and splitting installation from tenure end matches the implementation (`CasRefLedger.cpp:3855-3859,2165`). However, the proposed transitions remain under-specified: current `SenderApply` requires `sDurableRef # Token` (`CaRelinkConfirmCore.tla:192-199`), which never becomes true for `NoOp`; revision 4 names no replacement durable-phase marker, does not state that `SenderInstall` requires durability and clears `sPending`, and does not distinguish the post-install state from the pre-arm state. The witnesses also need history flags set by `RConfirm`; otherwise a stored earlier answer can later coexist with the desired sender state without that confirm occurring in it.

2. **PROSE — MAJOR — `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-02-cas-relink-confirm-liveness-design.md:164,192-202`**  
   Finding 2 is only partly closed. The companion modules are now in scope, but the proposed rewrite is incomplete. `CaRefLaneCore::Certify` currently protects not only `Ready`, but also current-runtime authority and cache/durable equality (`CaRefLaneCore.tla:714-722`). Replacing that property solely with “no certification while the armed attempt touches the identity” would discard those checks; retaining global `cache_id = durable_id` would instead reject a legitimately non-touching landed transaction. Preserve `CurrentRuntime` and identity-specific row currency while replacing only the `Ready` restriction. Also rerun `run_reflane.sh`, which owns the `CaRefLaneCore` battery (`run_reflane.sh:16-43`); `run_relinklane.sh` runs only `CaRelinkLaneComposition`. The composition is a separate abstract model, not a TLA component instance (`CaRelinkLaneComposition.tla:3-9,21-38`), so its touch observable must be modeled independently. Line 164 should say three modules, not two models.

3. **CODE — INFO (closed) — `src/Disks/tests/gtest_cas_ref_install_safety.cpp:241-275`; `src/Disks/tests/cas_test_helpers.h:1967-2024`**  
   `ChunkFaultBackend::Mode::Unresolved` with the single-attempt budget is the correct real-attempt wedge seam.

4. **PROSE — INFO (closed) — `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-02-cas-relink-confirm-liveness-design.md:260-275`**  
   Finding 3 is closed: the inventory now includes `CasRefLedger.h:616`, the gtest header, both affected `CaRelinkConfirmCore_RESULTS.md` passages, and the companion lane results/README material.

5. **PROSE — INFO (closed) — `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-02-cas-relink-confirm-liveness-design.md:12-20`; `docs/superpowers/cas/2026-09-02-f11-spec-consults.md:20,123,420,433`**  
   The status and committed consult record agree with the history: three Codex rounds and one independent Claude consult. Describing revision 2 as passing “on the design itself” is accurate; the objections were prose/model-plan specification findings.

REQUEST CHANGES — define an explicit durable/install phase for both transaction shapes; make `SenderInstall` require durability, clear `sPending` and `sArmed`, and retain `sLeader`; record all three witnesses at the actual `RConfirm` transition; preserve authority and identity-specific cache correctness in `CaRefLaneCore`; model the composition observable independently; rerun both `run_reflane.sh` and `run_relinklane.sh`; and correct “two models” to three modules.

## Codex round 5, revision 5: REQUEST CHANGES (model plan prose) {#codex-round-5}

1. **PROSE — MAJOR — `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-02-cas-relink-confirm-liveness-design.md:175-187`**  
   The translation of old `sPending` reads to `sPhase # idle` is incorrect. After `SenderInstall`, `sPhase = installed`, so this expression still says “pending” even though installation has cleared the attempt. Applied literally to the existing actions (`CaRelinkConfirmCore.tla:204-219`), it both enables `SenderPoison` after successful installation and prevents `FenceLoss` during the installed/open-tenure interval. Define pending as `sPhase \in {admitted, armed, durable}`, or give the actions explicit phase guards: `SenderPoison` should run only from `durable` and close the tenure; `FenceLoss` should retain the old no-pending meaning, including the `installed` phase. Also state whether a durable `noop` may poison.

2. **PROSE — MAJOR — `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-02-cas-relink-confirm-liveness-design.md:202-220`**  
   Both proposed certification predicates admit broken lanes. `Outstanding` covers only `Writing` and `Wedged` (`CaRefLaneCore.tla:143-144`), so `CurrentRuntime /\ ~(Outstanding /\ attempt_touches_identity)` permits `Certify` in `NeedsRecovery`, `Closed`, and `Faulted`. A reachable `NeedsRecovery` state with stale cache can therefore execute `Certify` and make the honest `run_reflane.sh` battery fail. The composition has the same defect: `~(lane # "Ready" /\ attempt_touches_source)` permits `ConfirmSource` in every broken state when the prior attempt was non-touching. Use an explicit allowable-lane predicate such as `lane = "Ready" \/ (lane \in {"Writing", "Wedged"} /\ ~attempt_touches_identity)`; broken states must always refuse. Apply the corresponding predicate to `ConfirmSource`, `RefuseBlockedConfirmation`, the sabotage action, and the renamed invariant.

3. **PROSE — MAJOR — `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-02-cas-relink-confirm-liveness-design.md:202-213`**  
   `CaRefLaneCore` still lacks an implementable definition of identity-specific currency. Its existing `WriteLands`, `ObserveDurable`, `InstallCommitted`, resolution, and recovery actions update the scalar bindings unconditionally (`CaRefLaneCore.tla:234-260,310-322,363-443`). The plan does not say where `attempt_touches_identity` lives, how it follows `attempt` into `resolver_attempt`, or which binding updates are suppressed for a transaction about another identity. Specify a fixed certified-row projection and carry the touch bit with the exact attempt/resolver; touching actions update that row, while non-touching actions advance the global transaction frontier without changing it. The complete `Certify`/`bad_certification` predicate must retain `CurrentRuntime`, the allowable-lane predicate, and that row’s cache/durable equality. Preserve the `SabotageNoFence` bypass explicitly; with the stated absolute `CurrentRuntime` guard, `CaRefLaneCore_sab_nofence.cfg` can no longer produce its expected counterexample.

4. **PROSE — MAJOR — `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-02-cas-relink-confirm-liveness-design.md:202-223`**  
   The companion modules still have no non-vacuity gate for the newly allowed behavior. Existing `W_Confirmation` can be reached in `Ready`, and the lane model has no certification witness, so both runners could pass after accidentally retaining the old `Ready`-only contract. Add history flags, witness invariants, configurations, and runner entries proving `Certify` and `ConfirmSource` occur while an outstanding `Writing`/`Wedged` attempt is non-touching. Preferably, the lane witness should cover the post-land state where the global durable frontier is ahead while the certified row remains current.

5. **PROSE — INFO (closed) — `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-02-cas-relink-confirm-liveness-design.md:166-200`**  
   Apart from finding 1, the round-4 confirm-core concerns are closed: the phases distinguish pre-arm, durable, and post-install states; `SenderInstall` requires durability and retains tenure; all three witnesses are recorded atomically inside `RConfirm`; and both `SabotageStaleCache` and `SabotageTouchBlind` retain reachable dangling-relink counterexamples.

6. **PROSE — INFO (closed) — `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-02-cas-relink-confirm-liveness-design.md:164,210-223`**  
   The plan now correctly says three modules, gives the composition its own touch observable, and names both `run_reflane.sh` and `run_relinklane.sh`.

REQUEST CHANGES — correct the `sPending`-to-phase mapping and poison/fence transitions; restrict certification to `Ready` or non-touching `Writing`/`Wedged` while always refusing broken lanes; fully specify `CaRefLaneCore` touch propagation, identity-row updates, and `SabotageNoFence`; and add companion-module witnesses for certification during a non-touching outstanding attempt.

## Claude consult (fresh agent), revision 7: REQUEST CHANGES; revision 8 check: APPROVE WITH NITS {#claude-consult-rev7}

### Consult: F11 spec revision 7 (`2026-09-02-cas-relink-confirm-liveness-design.md`) {#consult-f11-spec-revision-7-2026-09-02-cas-relink-confirm-li}

Independent adversarial read of revision 7 against the code on `cas-gc-rebuild`. Read-only. I did not read
`tmp/` or the consults document.

#### Verdict: REQUEST CHANGES {#verdict-request-changes}

One CODE-level hole (finding 1) reopens the `_sab_stalecache` hazard for the wedged lane. Everything
else in the design holds against the code. The fix is one line in rule 3 plus the prose that rests on
the false premise.

#### Failure asymmetry, stated first {#failure-asymmetry-stated-first}

- Over-refusing costs the receiver one retry-later (`NO_REPLICA_HAS_PART`, `DataPartsExchange.cpp:1554-1562`).
- Under-refusing lets a receiver promote a manifest whose blob GC may already have deleted
  (`CaRelinkConfirmCore_RESULTS.md:126-142`, `_sab_stalecache`). Not recoverable by a retry.

So every doubt below is resolved toward refusal. The F11 evidence itself bounds what liveness needs:
the ledger records `wedged_namespace_count` 0 throughout the livelock
(`2026-09-02-gcs-live-validation-ledger.md:160`). Wedges were not the cause; `pending`/`leader_active`
were. A fix that keeps `Wedged` refusing loses nothing F11 needs.

#### Findings {#findings-rev7}

##### 1. CODE, Critical: a wedged transaction is in neither `pending` nor `carved`, and rev 7 stops `Wedged` from refusing {#1-code-critical-a-wedged-transaction-is-in-neither-pending-n}

The spec claims (`:102-105`): "A wedged or unresolved item is not `done`, so it stays in `carved` and
keeps refusing for its ref until resolution or `NeedsRecovery`." The code does the opposite. Both
`Unresolved` arms of `commitRefChunk` complete the chunk's items with an error *before returning*:

- exception path: `CasRefLedger.cpp:3634-3644` sets `Writing -> Wedged` under `state_mutex`, then
  `complete_error(chunk_survivors, write_error)` (`done = true`, `:3243-3251`);
- outcome path: `CasRefLedger.cpp:3993-4006` sets `Wedged`, then `complete_error(chunk_survivors, ...)`.

The leader then exits and the exit guard (`:2146-2166`), where the spec clears `carved`, runs. Result:
lane `Wedged`, `append_attempt` holds a transaction that *may be durable*, the committed row does not
reflect it, `pending` and `carved` are empty for that ref. Under rev 7's rule 3 (`:77-85`) nothing
refuses. A confirm about the wedged ref reads the stale row and answers `Yes`.

This is exactly the hazard in §safety: the wedged transaction can be a removal or repoint of P that
landed; GC folds durable objects, not cached rows. The window is unbounded by design: there is no
background retry, the wedge waits for the next flush of that namespace or a remount
(`CasRefLedger.h:1132-1137`, `CasRefLedger.cpp:2371-2375`). Between the wedge and its adoption
(`:2534`) every confirm about the wedged ref is a `Yes` off a stale row.

Prediction that confirms the mechanism: the spec's own proposed sibling test (`:172-177`, real wedge
via `ChunkFaultBackend::Mode::Unresolved`, "the wedged ref answers `Unknown`") fails against a faithful
implementation of rev 7, because the wedged item is `done` and `carved` is empty. The test is right;
the design does not deliver it.

The same gap exists in the model text (`:142-143`): "the model's `sPending` spans admission to apply,
which is exactly the interval `pending` plus `carved` covers in the code". False on the wedge path,
where `pending` plus `carved` end at `complete_error` while durability is still unknown.

**Required change (minimum, recommended):** keep `Wedged` as a table-wide refusal. Rule 3's first line
becomes `lane_state != Ready && lane_state != Writing -> Unknown`. `Writing` is safe to exempt because
the chunk's items are in `carved` and not `done` from carve until the install swap at `:3855-3859`
(`done` follows the install at `:3900-3908`), and every exit from `Writing` is a lane transition
(`Ready` `:3859`/`:3925`/`:3969`, `Wedged` `:3641`/`:3997`, `NeedsRecovery` `:3778`/`:3787`/`:3813`/`:3846`,
`Closed` `:3711`, `Faulted` `:3689`/`:3737`). No new state, no allocation after the send, matches
today's behaviour for the state F11 never touched. In the confirm-core model `Wedged` maps onto the
existing `sPoison` semantics ("tenure closed, row stale, only a lane-state refusal can see it"); no new
model state is needed for it.

**Alternative (only if wedge-time liveness for unrelated refs is wanted):** record the chunk's scopes on
`RefAppendAttempt` in `prepareRefChunk` (`:3212-3215`, pre-send, so §A1 holds) and have rule 3 read
`rt.append_attempt->scopes` whenever the attempt is set. That makes `carved` unnecessary (between carve
and arming nothing has been sent, so the row is current) and is what the spec's lane-core sentence
("touch derived from `attempt.binding`", `:149-150`) actually describes. It is a larger change and
reintroduces the send/arm phase reasoning rev 7 set out to remove. Either is sound; do not ship neither.

##### 2. CODE, Major: `MutationScope` becomes safety-bearing but nothing checks it against the ops {#2-code-major-mutationscope-becomes-safety-bearing-but-nothin}

Today the scope is a batching hint (`CasRefProtocol.h:56-60`, `CasRefLedger.cpp:2870-2935`); a wrong
scope costs a duplicate-ref batch cut at worst. Under rev 7 a `Ref{X}` item whose `build_ops` mutates
Y is a stale-cache hole for Y. No site validates the declared scope against the emitted ops. The tree
already contains such an item: `gtest_cas_confirm_exact_ref.cpp:554-557` declares
`MutationScope::ref(prefix)` for an item whose ops touch `prefix + i` for 1500 refs
(`precommitAddRemovePairs`, `:180-198`). Harmless today, a counterexample to the design's invariant
tomorrow.

Audit of production callers (question A), all consistent:
`CasPartWriteTxn.cpp:657` (precommit add + optional `NamespaceBirth`, binding on `final_ref_name`),
`:769` (promote: old-committed removal, precommit->committed transition, `SetPublishedAt`, all
`final_ref_name`, `:900-920`), `:1044` (precommit removal of `precommit_final_ref`);
`CasPool.cpp:1524` (precommit removal of `duty->ref_name`); `PartFolderAccess.cpp:660` (committed
removal of `key.ref`); `CasRefLedger.cpp:4672` (`wholeShard`, many precommit removals), `:4729`
(committed removal of `ref_name`), `:4772` (`SetPublishedAt` on `ref_name`), `:5149` (`wholeShard`,
whole-namespace removal). `republishRef` (`PartFolderAccess.cpp:506-535`) is two separate appends,
destination promote via `publishEntries` then `dropRef(src)`, each with its own scope. No binding
change happens outside these three installers of `rt->state`: recovery `:1625`, wedge adoption
`:2534`, commit `:3855`.

**Required change:** in `flushRefBatch` step 3 (`CasRefLedger.cpp:3060-3120`, pre-durability), for a
`Kind::Ref` item, fail the item (`LOGICAL_ERROR`, fail-closed, only that item) if any
`OwnerTransition` binding's `ref_name` or any `SetPublishedAt.ref_name` differs from
`scope.ref_name`. Add a gtest. Adapt `MidTenureChunkBoundaryIsUnknown`'s helper to a single-ref item
(same ref, 1500 distinct manifests; precommits are keyed by `(ref, manifest)`, `:4661`) so two items
still co-batch and chunk. Update the `MutationScope` doc comment (`CasRefProtocol.h:56-60`), which is
missing from the spec's docs list.

##### 3. PROSE, Major: spec sentences that rest on finding 1's false premise {#3-prose-major-spec-sentences-that-rest-on-finding-1-s-false-}

- `:88-89` "`Writing` and `Wedged` no longer refuse by themselves" -> only `Writing`.
- `:102-105` the wedged-item paragraph -> replace with: a wedged transaction's items are completed
  with an error before the tenure ends; the lane state carries the refusal.
- `:104-105` `forceWedgeForTest` pushing a `WholeShard` item into `carved` -> unnecessary; the seam
  stays as it is (`:1866-1878`).
- `:142-143` the `sPending`/`carved` equivalence -> `pending` plus `carved` cover the non-wedged tenure;
  `Wedged` is covered by the lane state (model: `sPoison`).
- `:172-177` sibling test -> with a real wedge, *both* the wedged ref and the unrelated ref answer
  `Unknown`; the wedged ref by lane state, the unrelated ref because the lane state is table-wide.
- `:146-155` lane models -> "`Ready`, or `Writing` and the outstanding attempt does not touch the
  identity"; `Wedged` stays excluded, alongside the broken states. The lane core keeps the attempt in
  both states (`CaRefLaneCore.tla:1062`), so the sabotage "certify while the attempt touches" and the
  witness "certified while `Writing`" are expressible as written.
- `:189-195` counters -> split `Wedged` out of `LaneBroken` (or name it) so the live gate can tell
  whether wedges ever cost liveness.

##### 4. PROSE, Minor: "the refusing rule named in the existing debug line" needs an API change {#4-prose-minor-the-refusing-rule-named-in-the-existing-debug-}

`ConfirmAnswer` is a three-value enum (`CasRefLedger.h:69`) and the debug line at
`DataPartsExchange.cpp:294` receives only `CasConfirmAnswer` through
`ContentAddressedMetadataStorage::confirmExactRef` (`:2105-2145`) and the exchange interface
(`ContentAddressedExchange.h:177`). Naming the rule there means widening the return type through
three layers, which contradicts `:107-108` "no new API". Either state the API change or keep the
rule attribution inside the ledger (ProfileEvents plus a ledger-side `LOG_TRACE`). Recommend the
latter.

##### 5. PROSE, Minor: the `noop` shape cannot close its tenure in the model as sketched {#5-prose-minor-the-noop-shape-cannot-close-its-tenure-in-the-}

`SenderApply` (`CaRelinkConfirmCore.tla:192-198`) is guarded by `sDurableRef # Token`. A `noop`
tenure leaves `sDurableRef = Token`, so it can never apply and `SenderAdmit`'s `~sPending` (`:166`)
blocks any later touching admit. The interleaving "yes while noop pending, then a touching mutation
admitted after T2, durable, folded" would be unreachable, and it is the one the protocol argument
(`:111-114`) claims is safe. Make `SenderApply`'s guard shape-aware. `SenderDurable` (`:180`) works for
`noop` with `sTarget = Token` as long as its journal record is the edge-neutral `NsNoise` op, as the
spec says.

##### 6. PROSE, Minor: `carve_all_pending` is a second carve path the spec does not mention {#6-prose-minor-carve-all-pending-is-a-second-carve-path-the-s}

`flushRefBatch`'s failure arms (`CasRefLedger.cpp:2731-2737`, `:2751-2755`, `:2764-2769`, `:2788-2792`,
`:2839-2843`, `:2887-2895`) pop *all* of `pending` and complete the items with an error without ever
adding them to `owned_items`. Nothing was sent for them, so no `carved` mirror is needed. Say so in
the carve comment, or a future reader will "fix" it.

##### 7. Optional, Minor: make the `Writing` exemption self-checking {#7-optional-minor-make-the-writing-exemption-self-checking}

Under the recommended fix the safety of exempting `Writing` rests on "`Writing` implies the chunk's
items are in `carved` and not `done`". Cheap to make executable: in rule 3, `lane_state == Writing &&
rt.carved.empty() -> Unknown` (plus a `chassert`). Fail-closed if a future arm ever leaves `Writing`
without a leader.

#### Questions B to E, answered against the code {#questions-b-to-e-answered-against-the-code}

**B, window coverage (with finding 1 fixed).** Admission `pending.push_back` `:2047` under
`ref_queue_mutex`; carve `:2917-2935` is one continuous `ref_queue_mutex` hold, PLAN then no-throw
PUBLISH, so `carved` can be appended atomically with the pop. The leader's own item sits in `pending`
until carved (`owned_items` at `:2099` is not the marker; the item is still queued). Validation
failures (`:2999`, `:3115`) leave never-sent items in `carved` until the exit guard: over-refusal only.
Multi-chunk: chunk N's items stay in `carved` after install until the exit guard: over-refusal only.
Frontier failure and both install refusals go to `NeedsRecovery` (`:3778`, `:3787`, `:3813`, `:3846`),
refused; re-recovery runs with `recovery_in_progress` (`:1409`), refused by rule 2, and installs the
full replay with `lane_state = Ready` (`:1638-1640`). Faulted arms `:3686-3690`, `:3734-3738` and the
non-`Ready`-at-allocation arm `:3378-3382` reset the attempt and refuse. `Closed` `:3708-3712`,
`:2490-2493` refuses. `DefiniteFailure` `:3919-3927` and `NoAttemptSent` `:3963-3972` return to `Ready`
with nothing sent. Restart: no in-memory wedge survives, recovery replays the durable log. Every
instant in which a mutation of P may be durable and the row not updated is then covered by `carved`
(Writing) or by the lane state (Wedged/NeedsRecovery/Closed/Faulted).

**C, locking.** Confirm holds `ref_queue_mutex` throughout and `try_lock`s `state_mutex` under it
(`:437`, `:456`). Carve, `done`, and the exit-guard erase are all under `ref_queue_mutex`
(`:2917`, `:3243`, `:2151`). Install is under `state_mutex` only (`:3801`), with `done` afterwards under
`ref_queue_mutex` (`:3900`); the confirm that lands between them sees the item in `carved` and not
`done`, so it refuses. No TOCTOU. Lock order queue-then-state is never inverted by the leader
(`complete_error` is always called after the `state_mutex` scope closes).

**D, cross-ref effects.** `OwnerTransition` shapes are AddPrecommit, RemovePrecommit, RemoveCommitted
(one binding) and Promote, which requires `old.ref_name == new.ref_name`
(`CasRefProtocol.cpp:130-154`). `SetPublishedAt` names one ref. `NamespaceBirth` has no binding.
`RemoveNamespace` is only reachable under `wholeShard` (`:5149`). `EpochSeal` is minted only by the
recovery walk (`:1107`, `makeEpochSealTxn` `:137`), not through the lane, and carries no table content.
No op changes a binding other than the one its scope names.

**E, what the old refusals protected that scope does not.** `Wedged`: finding 1. `Writing`: covered by
`carved`. `leader_active`: added nothing beyond `carved` plus `Wedged`. Non-empty `pending`: covered by
scope. The receiver-side T1 < T2 order the argument needs holds (`DataPartsExchange.cpp:1462-1480`
publishes and makes the `+1` durable before the confirm at `:1509-1536`).

**F, tests and model.** `InFlightAppendIsUnknown` (`:472`) and `ConcurrentAppendIsOrderedAfterTheSnapshot`
(`:672`) park the leader before the carve, so the same-ref item is in `pending`: `Unknown` by scope,
expectations hold. `MidTenureChunkBoundaryIsUnknown` (`:512`) confirms an untouched ref at the reseed:
`Yes` is correct (after the item-scope fix of finding 2). `WedgedLaneIsUnknown` (`:589`) stays `Unknown`
under the recommended fix with no seam change. The sibling test's second expectation is wrong (finding
3). `SabotageTouchBlind` and the `sawYesWhilePendingNoop` witness are non-vacuous as sketched, subject
to finding 5. Lane-model sentences are consistent with `Certify` (`CaRefLaneCore.tla:714-722`) and
`ConfirmSource` (`CaRelinkLaneComposition.tla:111`) once `Wedged` is kept excluded.

#### Simplifications (more than the minimum) {#simplifications-more-than-the-minimum}

1. Drop the `forceWedgeForTest` change (`:104-105`); with `Wedged` refusing it is not needed.
2. Drop "named in the existing debug line" (`:191-192`); ProfileEvents inside the ledger suffice and
   need no API change.
3. §safety's `MergeTree`-level paragraph (`:50-59`) is background; rule 3 plus rule 5 carry the
   safety, gate 0 is declared an availability filter (`:93`). Keep one sentence.
4. The confirm-core model needs no new state for `Wedged` under the recommended fix; do not add an arm
   or phase. Only the `noop` shape, the shape-aware `SenderApply`, the sabotage and the witness.

#### Limits of what I established {#limits-of-what-i-established}

- I verified coverage of the lane windows from the code paths cited above. I did not run anything; no
  test or model was executed for this report.
- I did not verify that the ref drop of a whole-part removal happens inside `remove()` (`:53`); it is
  not load-bearing for the design as written.
- I did not measure wedge frequency on GCS under chaos. The `wedged_namespace_count` 0 figure is the
  ledger's for the F11 window only; a wedge under chaos would cost that namespace's confirms until
  its next flush, which under write load is immediate.
- The LIST-completeness caveat is unchanged and outside this design, as the spec says.

### Revision 8 check (commit `82eb144fadf`) {#revision-8-check-commit-82eb144fadf}

#### Verdict: APPROVE WITH NITS {#verdict-approve-with-nits}

The safety argument is closed. Every required change from the revision 7 report is present in the
text and matches the code it cites. Two new defects, both in the test plan, must be fixed in the
spec before a plan is written from it; neither reopens the design.

#### Required changes from revision 7: status {#required-changes-from-revision-7-status}

| # | Required change | Rev 8 | Where |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `Wedged` refuses table-wide; rule 3 first line `!= Ready && != Writing` | closed | `:79-80`, `:91-97` |
| 1 | optional self-check `Writing && carved.empty() -> Unknown` | closed | `:81-82` |
| 1 | wedged-item paragraph and `forceWedgeForTest` change removed | closed | `:114-115` |
| 2 | scope validation in `flushRefBatch` step 3, `LOGICAL_ERROR`, offending item only | closed | `:117-122` |
| 2 | confirm-test helper rewritten to one ref, 1500 manifests | closed | `:121-122` |
| 2 | `MutationScope` comment in the docs list | closed | `:241-242` |
| 3 | "`Writing` no longer refuses by itself" | closed | `:91-92` |
| 3 | `sPending`/`carved` equivalence restated; wedge = `sPoison` | closed | `:161-163` |
| 3 | wedge sibling test expects `Unknown` for both refs | closed | `:193-197` |
| 3 | lane models exempt only `Writing` | closed | `:167-170` |
| 3 | counters gain `LaneWedged` | closed | `:212`, `:226` |
| 4 | rule attribution inside the ledger, no API widening | closed | `:213-215` |
| 5 | `SenderApply` guard shape-aware | closed | `:156-157` |
| 6 | `carve_all_pending` arms need no mirror | closed | `:112-114` |

Verified against the code, not only the text: the self-check's "cannot happen" (`:82`) holds today.
`Writing` is set only at `CasRefLedger.cpp:3593`, inside `commitRefChunk`, which is reached only
after a non-empty carve (`:2934`), and every exit from `Writing` is a lane transition (list in the
revision 7 report, finding 1). The helper rewrite is feasible: `AddPrecommit` requires only that the
exact `(ref, manifest)` is absent and the manifest has no other owner (`CasRefProtocol.cpp:246-260`),
which sequential add/remove pairs on one ref with distinct manifests satisfy.

#### New findings {#new-findings}

##### R8-1. PROSE, Major: "the only offender in the tree is a test helper" is false {#r8-1-prose-major-the-only-offender-in-the-tree-is-a-test-hel}

`:120-122` claims the confirm-test helper is the only `Ref{X}` item whose ops touch other refs.
Untruncated grep of `MutationScope::ref(` over `src/Disks/tests/` finds five more, all in
`gtest_cas_ref_chunked_flush.cpp`, all the same shape (`Ref{"item_a"}` over
`addRemovePrecommitPairs("aaa_", ...)`, which builds bindings on `aaa_ref_000000` and so on,
`:461-479`):

- `:594-598` (`item_a`/`item_b`/`item_c` over `aaa_`/`bbb_`/`ccc_` pairs, `:580-582`)
- `:703-705`
- `:826-828`
- `:889-891`

With the scope validation as specified, each of these items fails with `LOGICAL_ERROR`, which in a
debug or sanitizer build aborts the process (`Exception.cpp:88-92`), so the whole `CAS*` gate binary
dies at the first of them. These tests exist to exercise chunking, so they need co-batched items with
distinct scopes; the fix is the same as for the confirm-test helper: one ref per item, distinct
manifests. Add the five sites to `:120-122` and to the tests section.

Two more sites are safe only by ordering, worth aligning anyway: `:248` (`Ref{"oversized"}` over
`fillerOps`, default `RefOp{}` = `NamespaceBirth`, not a checked kind) and `:285`
(`Ref{"oversized_op"}` over a `SetPublishedAt` whose `ref_name` is a padded string, `:164-166`). Both
items fail the step-1 caps (`:2977-2992`) before step 3 runs. If the check is ever moved ahead of the
caps, `:285` breaks. Cheapest is to give that item the scope its op names.

Every other test-side `Ref{X}` verified consistent: `gtest_cas_ref_lane_exception_safety.cpp:60,
129, 202` (empty ops), `gtest_cas_ref_recovery_cas_walk.cpp:443, 459` and siblings (`"a"`/`"b"`
match `publishCommittedOps`), `gtest_cas_part_write.cpp:1700` (`"part_1"` matches), and the five
`publishRef`/`publishBirth` helpers in `gtest_cas_ref_ckpt.cpp:76`,
`gtest_cas_ref_catalog_birth_wiring.cpp:107`, `gtest_cas_detached_work.cpp:269, 284`,
`gtest_cas_ref_snapshot_publish_ordering.cpp:70`, `gtest_cas_ref_contiguous_alloc.cpp:146` (`ref`
matches; `NamespaceBirth` is not a checked kind, correctly, since `precommitAdd` emits it under a
`Ref` scope at `CasPartWriteTxn.cpp:693-700`).

##### R8-2. TEST, Major: the scope-validation gtest must be a death test in debug and sanitizer builds {#r8-2-test-major-the-scope-validation-gtest-must-be-a-death-t}

`:203-204` says the new test asserts the item "fails before durability, with `LOGICAL_ERROR`". A
`LOGICAL_ERROR` constructed in a debug or sanitizer build aborts (`Exception.cpp:88-92`); the abort
happens on the leader thread when `complete_error`'s exception object is built, exactly as for the
existing exit-guard and `!attempt_armed` arms (`:2153`, `:3610`). The file must use the established
split: `EXPECT_THROW` plus a code check under `#ifndef DEBUG_OR_SANITIZER_BUILD`, `EXPECT_DEATH`
under `#if defined(DEBUG_OR_SANITIZER_BUILD)` (pattern at
`gtest_cas_promote_republish.cpp:293-337`). Say so in the tests section, or the first debug gate run
is red. `LOGICAL_ERROR` remains the right class: the mismatch is reachable only through an in-tree
caller, never through input.

##### R8-3. PROSE, Minor: three citations drifted {#r8-3-prose-minor-three-citations-drifted}

- `:107` "`CasRefLedger.cpp:2917-2935`" for the carve: the block runs `:2876-2933` (`batch` declared
  at `:2876`, `if (batch.empty())` at `:2934`).
- `:118` "step 3 (`:3060-3120`)": the step-3 comment starts at `:3045`.
- `:94` "`:3993-4006`" is right (`Wedged` at `:3997`, counter at `:3999`); "`:3634-3644`" is right.

#### Limits {#limits-rev8}

- Text and cited code lines were checked; nothing was run. R8-1 predicts that the five
  `gtest_cas_ref_chunked_flush.cpp` sites fail once the scope check lands; the implementer's first
  gate run is the experiment.
- I did not re-derive the lane-window coverage; revision 8 changes rule 3 exactly as the revision 7
  report required and adds no new state or path.

## Codex round 6, revision 8: REQUEST CHANGES (model plan and inventory prose; design confirmed) {#codex-round-6}

Run 2026-09-02 15:05-15:2x local, `gpt-5.6-sol`, reasoning `high`, read-only sandbox, 264,936 tokens; prompt `tmp/gcs_live_20260902/codex_review_f11_spec_r7_prompt.txt` (revision 8 text plus question 7 on the test inventory), log `tmp/gcs_live_20260902/codex_review_f11_spec_r8.log`. Verbatim report (absolute paths shortened to repository-relative):

1. **PROSE — medium:** The model plan does not cover all newly reachable transitions or prove the important post-durability relaxation. It makes only `SenderApply` shape-aware (design (`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-02-cas-relink-confirm-liveness-design.md:157`)), but `SenderPoison` also requires `sDurableRef # Token` ([CaRelinkConfirmCore.tla](docs/superpowers/models/CaRelinkConfirmCore.tla:201)). Consequently, a durable `noop` whose installation fails cannot enter the modeled broken state, although any real chunk can become `NeedsRecovery` after frontier or install failure ([CasRefLedger.cpp](src/Disks/DiskObjectStorage/MetadataStorages/ContentAddressed/Pool/CasRefLedger.cpp:3773), [CasRefLedger.cpp](src/Disks/DiskObjectStorage/MetadataStorages/ContentAddressed/Pool/CasRefLedger.cpp:3808)). The statement that a wedged tenure “is the model’s `sPoison`” is also inconsistent with the model, where `sPoison` specifically means a known-durable transaction whose apply failed, not an ambiguous `Wedged` attempt ([CaRelinkConfirmCore.tla](docs/superpowers/models/CaRelinkConfirmCore.tla:117), [CaRelinkConfirmCore.tla](docs/superpowers/models/CaRelinkConfirmCore.tla:201)).

   The companion-model plan is similarly ambiguous about “identity currency.” After a non-touching `WriteLands`, `durable_id` advances while `cache_id` remains behind ([CaRefLaneCore.tla](docs/superpowers/models/CaRefLaneCore.tla:234)), but current `Certify` requires `cache_id = durable_id` ([CaRefLaneCore.tla](docs/superpowers/models/CaRefLaneCore.tla:714)). Retaining that condition permits the proposed witness only before durability and omits the slow post-`PUT`, pre-install window this change is meant to open. Specify that non-touching `Writing` certification relies on binding equality rather than global transaction-ID equality; make `SenderPoison` shape-aware; model `Wedged` explicitly or document a faithful abstraction; and require a witness after the no-op has become durable but before install. The composition model should likewise persist and clear the nondeterministic touch flag across every terminal write transition.

2. **CODE/TEST — low:** The revision-8 test inventory names every affected source region, but its counts and “aligned anyway” claim are false (design (`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-02-cas-relink-confirm-liveness-design.md:121`)). The confirm helper is invoked twice, producing two mis-scoped items ([gtest_cas_confirm_exact_ref.cpp](src/Disks/tests/gtest_cas_confirm_exact_ref.cpp:552)). The four cited chunked-flush regions contain nine direct mis-scoped append expressions, not five: three at lines 594–598 and two at each of 703–705, 826–828, and 889–891. Moreover, the oversized `SetPublishedAt` item declares `Ref{"oversized_op"}` while its op names the long padded `"r..."` ref ([gtest_cas_ref_chunked_flush.cpp](src/Disks/tests/gtest_cas_ref_chunked_flush.cpp:168), [gtest_cas_ref_chunked_flush.cpp](src/Disks/tests/gtest_cas_ref_chunked_flush.cpp:279)); it is safe only because the step-1 size cap rejects it before step 3 ([CasRefLedger.cpp](src/Disks/DiskObjectStorage/MetadataStorages/ContentAddressed/Pool/CasRefLedger.cpp:2968)). Correct the counts and set that item’s scope from `oversized_op.ref_name`. The proposed repeated add/remove pairs on one ref are otherwise valid: removal erases the exact `(ref, manifest)` and ownership before the next distinct manifest is added ([CasRefProtocol.cpp](src/Disks/DiskObjectStorage/MetadataStorages/ContentAddressed/Pool/CasRefProtocol.cpp:246), [CasRefProtocol.cpp](src/Disks/DiskObjectStorage/MetadataStorages/ContentAddressed/Pool/CasRefProtocol.cpp:268)).

3. **PROSE — low:** The `carved` description first says items are “completed and erased only” by the tenure exit guard, then correctly says installed or validation-failed items remain mirrored until that guard (design (`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-02-cas-relink-confirm-liveness-design.md:105`)). Today items are completed on validation/error paths or immediately after install ([CasRefLedger.cpp](src/Disks/DiskObjectStorage/MetadataStorages/ContentAddressed/Pool/CasRefLedger.cpp:2696), [CasRefLedger.cpp](src/Disks/DiskObjectStorage/MetadataStorages/ContentAddressed/Pool/CasRefLedger.cpp:3899)); the exit guard only completes survivors and releases leadership ([CasRefLedger.cpp](src/Disks/DiskObjectStorage/MetadataStorages/ContentAddressed/Pool/CasRefLedger.cpp:2141)). Say that completion may happen earlier but `rt.carved` retains every carved item until the exit guard clears the mirror.

Closed: all production binding mutations use an exact `Ref` scope or conservative `WholeShard`; `republishRef` publishes `dst` and drops `src` through separate correctly scoped appends; the recovery-written epoch seal changes no binding. With the proposed `carved` mirror, the admission-to-install window is covered under `ref_queue_mutex`; `Wedged` and broken states cover post-tenure ambiguity; recovery installs the replay before returning to `Ready`. The stated unit-test expectation changes, real-wedge expectations, stale-row construction using `PostDurableInstall`, and `EXPECT_THROW`/`EXPECT_DEATH` split are correct.

REQUEST CHANGES — complete and disambiguate the three model rewrites, correct the test inventory and oversized-item scope, and fix the contradictory `carved` lifetime prose.

### Verification and disposition {#codex-round-6-disposition}

All three findings verified against the code and accepted; none touches the design's safety argument, which the report's "Closed" paragraph confirms (completeness of `MutationScope` at every caller, `republishRef`'s two correctly scoped appends, the window coverage of the `carved` mirror under `ref_queue_mutex`, `Wedged` and the broken states, recovery, the unit-test expectation changes, the stale-row construction at `PostDurableInstall`, the death split).

1. Model plan. Confirmed: `SenderPoison` (`CaRelinkConfirmCore.tla:204-211`) requires `sDurableRef # Token`, so a durable `noop` could never poison although the code sends any chunk to `NeedsRecovery` on a frontier or install failure (`CasRefLedger.cpp:3773`, `:3808`); `Certify` (`CaRefLaneCore.tla:719-722`) requires `cache_id = durable_id`, which a non-touching `WriteLands` (`:234`) breaks, so a witness kept under that condition would only reach a pre-durability certification; "a wedged tenure is the model's `sPoison`" conflated an ambiguous attempt with a known-durable failed apply. Applied in spec revision 9 (§model): `NoopDurable`, shape-aware `SenderApply` and `SenderPoison` through one `TenureDurable` guard, the witness set only while `NoopDurable`, binding equality as the lane core's certification currency, the composition's touch flag cleared on every transition out of `Writing`, `W_CertifiedWhileOutstanding` set only when `durable_id = attempt.id`, and `sPoison` described as the worst-case abstraction of `Wedged` (the ambiguous transaction taken as durable; the refusal is identical) rather than as its model. The plan's Tasks 1 and 2 carry the same changes.
2. Test inventory. Confirmed by an untruncated grep: the confirm test's helper lambda is called twice (`gtest_cas_confirm_exact_ref.cpp:552-558`), the four chunked-flush regions hold nine append expressions (three at `:594-598`, two at each of the others), and `OversizedOpFailsItsItemAlone` (`:279-285`) declares `Ref{"oversized_op"}` over a `SetPublishedAt` naming the padded `r...` ref, rejected only by the step-1 size cap (`CasRefLedger.cpp:2968`). Spec revision 9 states eleven expressions and sets that item's scope from `oversized_op.ref_name`; the plan's Task 4 already did both.
3. `carved` lifetime prose. Confirmed: items are completed at install (`CasRefLedger.cpp:3899`) or through `complete_error` (`:2696`), and the exit guard (`:2141-2167`) completes only stranded survivors. Spec revision 9 (§carved) and the plan's Task 3 comments say completion may come earlier and the mirror retains every carved item until the exit guard.

Verdict as applied: the design stands as reviewed in revision 8; revision 9 changes prose and the model plan only. No further external review is scheduled before implementation; the model batteries (Tasks 1 and 2 of the plan) are the check on the model plan.
